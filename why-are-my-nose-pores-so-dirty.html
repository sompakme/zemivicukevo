When a sebum plug forms, bacteria that normally lives harmlessly on the surface of your skin can start to grow within the follicle.<h2>Why do blackheads keep filling up?</h2>Prolonged exposure to the air causes the blockage to oxidize and darken. Because the pore gets stretched out of shape, it will fill back up again even after it is emptied. These stubborn pores are most likely to occur on the face, chest and back.<h2>What foods reduce pores on face?</h2>The humble cucumber is the best way to bid goodbye to enlarged pores because the high silica content in the vegetable not only imparts a youthful look to the skin but also helps in tightening the large pores.

The pores can also become inflamed if the blackhead isn't treated.</p><h2>Should you extract blackheads?</h2>Clearing away blackheads is a multi-step process that requires using the proper cleanser, regular exfoliation, a solid retinol regimen, and—yup—extractions. "One of the most important ways to get rid of blackheads is to extract them out," says Dr. Gohara.<h2>Should I squeeze sebum plugs?</h2>Don't: Squeeze them.<p>You might see a gnarly-looking plug in the mirror, your fingers practically itching to pop and squeeze the blemish—don't. "Squeezing can traumatize the skin, introduce bacteria, and damage the pore, which can spread debris and bacteria deeper into the tissue," King notes.</p><h2>Is it OK to remove sebum?</h2>Though you may be tempted to squeeze or otherwise get rid of a sebaceous filament, it's best to leave them alone.

This oil, called sebum, helps keep your skin soft. Dead skin cells and oils collect in the opening to the skin follicle, producing a bump called a comedo. If the skin over the bump stays closed, the bump is called a whitehead.<h2>How do you draw out a deep blackhead?</h2>To begin, place a warm, damp cloth over the blackhead for several minutes to help open the pore and make the plug easier to remove.
