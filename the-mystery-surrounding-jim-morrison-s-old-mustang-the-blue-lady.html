Morrison was a noted heavy drinker, and often drove drunk.&nbsp;Unsurprisingly, that meant he crashed his ride more than a few times, but was typically able to claim it was stolen and quietly pay off whatever damages he owed. The&nbsp;Blue Lady remained relatively unharmed, but something happened in the fall of 1969.</p><p>One account claims that Morrison crashed his car into a light pole, promptly went to a favorite local bar to spend the rest of the night, and returned to find The Blue Lady missing. Others attest that Morrison left it at Los Angeles International Airport while on tour, and it was towed and sold at a public auction. Others say that Morrison totaled his beloved Mustang, and it was crushed for scrap. Whatever the case, if anyone does find The Blue Lady — if it's even there to be found — it would no doubt be one of the most valuable Mustangs in the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDkG1pb29fqbWmecyyqq2doq56tMHRq6auppSeu6h5yaKkZqWfp7%2Bqv86nqmannJl6rsHSrZinn12ptaZ5waWsnmWclrG6ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
