The result is fewer pilots, a shift to year-round development and now fewer scripted originals as networks bulk up on unscripted fare, cut costs and continue to see development money shifted toward streaming.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On the leadership front, Frances Berwick now has lone oversight of <a href=# id=auto-tag_nbc data-tag=nbc>NBC</a> after Susan Rovner was let go from NBCUniversal as part of a larger restructuring, with <a href=# id=auto-tag_abc data-tag=abc>ABC</a> (Craig Erwich), <a href=# id=auto-tag_cbs data-tag=cbs>CBS</a> (Amy Reisenbach), <a href=# id=auto-tag_cw data-tag=cw>The CW</a> (Brad Schwartz) and <a href=# id=auto-tag_fox data-tag=fox>Fox</a> (Rob Wade) continuing with their current executives.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The biggest shift in broadcast is the shortened 2023-24 seasons of scripted fare, production on which was delayed from the traditional summer start to the end of 2023 after the resolution of both the writers and actors strikes. With shorter order seasons coming amid larger efforts to reduce costs, a number of veteran shows ranging from CBS’ Blue Bloods to ABC’s Station 19 are ending their respective runs as most broadcast networks almost exclusively buy from their own in-house studios. With the focus on getting established shows back into production, most new comedies and dramas — which typically require more time to find their footing — have been bumped to the 2024-25 broadcast season rather than being rushed to air amid a cluttered schedule. That will mean that networks will have fewer needs for new comedies and dramas, which has led to a dramatically reduced volume of pilots expected to be picked up this season. CBS is skipping orders altogether this season, while Fox and The CW use other models.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In keeping with tradition, here’s The Hollywood Reporter’s handy guide of scripted broadcast shows that are coming back, what’s canceled (or ending) and what’s been added to the 2024-25 schedule at ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and The CW.
