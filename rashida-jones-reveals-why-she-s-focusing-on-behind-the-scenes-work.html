I stopped going after big movies because what comes with it is they want you to be as famous as possible […] I don’t have the constitution to battle that.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Jones is most-known for her roles in comedic shows like “The Office,” “Parks and Recreation,” and most recently, “Angie Tribeca” while starring on the big screen in films like “I Love You, Man” and “The Social Network.” But recently, she’s been taking her post behind-the-scenes working as a producer and writer.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“The reason I got behind the camera was because I felt replaceable as an actress,” she said. “You walk into a room, and they’ve already decided whether you’ve got the part based on your hair.
