He had a fallout with former friend and label head Sean "<a href=# class=text-word rel>Diddy</a>" Combs, and later, Mase emerged at the pulpit as a pastor. With his music career seemingly behind him, infrequent Mase news was shared about his grievances with Diddy not selling him his own masters.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after Fivio mentioned that he signed a deal with Mase earlier on in his career, the "<a href=# rel>Tell Me What You Want</a>" hitmaker was back in the headlines. He's defending himself against critics and has been more active on social media, and now, Mase is recruiting for his label, Rich Fish.</p><p>Kevin Winter / Staff / Getty Images</p><p>In a video shared to Instagram, Mase is seen saying, "Yo, check this out. You lookin' to get signed? You want to really get to the bag? You lookin' for a big deal and you don't wanna sleep your way to the top? You really don't need nobody dancin' all in your videos? Then you need to come to Rich Fish."</p><p>"We the only ones gettin' people rich," Mase continued. "Over here, the label just don't get rich, we get the people rich, man."</p><p>This brief clip comes months after Diddy not only announced his all-R&B label, Love Records, but it also follows the release of his <a href=# class=text-word rel>Bryson Tiller</a>-assisted single, "Gotta Move On." Check out Mase's video below and let us know if you think this <a href=# rel>was a shot at Diddy</a>&nbsp;or a nod to the infamous 1995 The Source Awards.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">A post shared by MA$â‚¬ (@rsvpmase)</a></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZoV6fZVmpJqrlWLEorrTrGSnnadirrPAyKyrrGWWpL9uuMCbnKVloKe8rrXSnqpmpp9ivK%2BxjLCgpaRdl7JusMCnmqKmXZa5rXnIp2Syp6Wnere1w56mrGWemsS0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
