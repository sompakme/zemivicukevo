The plot will pick up almost immediately from where part one finished – with <a class=hm-link href=#>the death of Diana, Princess of Wales</a> (<strong>Elizabeth Debicki</strong>) and her then-partner, Dodi Al Fayed (<strong>Khalid Abdalla</strong>) – before jumping ahead to the early 2000s.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: The Crown season six part two official trailer</figure><p id=eYvrIalM6h2 data-wc=34>The Crown's sixth and final season also gives us the chance to meet the fresh-faced actors who will be playing the adolescent versions of <a class=hm-link href=#>Princes William</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Harry</a> and William's future wife, <a class=hm-link href=#>Kate Middleton</a>.</p><p id=eiGJhZGzri1 data-wc=43>But the drama series has featured many child actors who have brilliantly portrayed major royals roles throughout its six-season run. To mark the show coming to an end, <strong>we look back at those young and ambitious stars who have appeared in The Crown…</strong></p><h2>Prince William</h2><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=e18fe79315ab-senan-west-as-charles>Senan West</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e18fe79315ab-senan-west-as-charles.png><p>When the character of a young <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> first came to The Crown in season five when depicting the early to mid-1990s, the role was in fact given to <a href=#><strong>Dominic West</strong></a>'s son, <strong>Senan</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the father-son duo no doubt had a blast filming together on set, it was then reported that Dominic's son wouldn't be back to reprise his role again.</p><p><strong>"I loved watching him do it,"</strong> The Wire&nbsp;actor told Radio Times, adding: "So that was wonderful but when it gets very emotional, it can get a bit weird. When he had to cry, it was horrible."&nbsp;</p><p>Dominic then added that Senan decided not to return due to feeling the more emotional scenes in season six would be tricky.</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=639dc236d760-rufus-kampa-as-william>Rufus Kampa</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/639dc236d760-rufus-kampa-as-william.jpg><p>Instead of Senan, <strong>Rufus Kampa</strong> was then cast to play the young Prince William for season six part one.&nbsp;</p><p>The actor did a tremendous job portraying the Prince of Wales as a 15 year old, coping with his teenage years and being rocked by his mother's tragic death. The Crown was Rufus' first major role.<br></p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=494de95b4052-thecrownparttwoimages87>Ed McVey</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/494de95b4052-thecrownparttwoimages87.jpg><p>In part two of season six, we meet Prince William in his University years, where he met and fell in love with a young <a href=#><strong>Kate Middleton</strong></a>.</p><p>Although not a child actor, we can't wait to watch <a href=#><strong>Ed McVey</strong></a> give his spin on the role.

Luther has been working in the industry prior to his acting gig, however. His IMDb profile states he previously directed a few short films.</p><p>Here, the actor is seen in character laughing with his on-screen brother, William, played by Ed McVey.

In season one, he was mostly portrayed as the firstborn child to a newly-crowned Queen Elizabeth II (played by <a href=#><strong>Claire Foy</strong></a>) and Prince Philip (played by <a href=#><strong>Matt Smith</strong></a>). By the time it got to season two, the young Prince was portrayed by <strong>Billy Jenkins.</strong></p><p>Billy's role as Charles was one of his first major parts on screen, but he has since gone on to star in Dodger, Peaky Blinders and Holmes & Watson. In season three, <strong>Josh O'Connor</strong> took over the role, before making way for <strong>Dominic West.</strong></p><h2>Princess Anne</h2><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=7e5cf32e4288-the-crown-charles-and-anne>Grace and Amelia Gilmour</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7e5cf32e4288-the-crown-charles-and-anne.png><p><a href=#><strong>Princess Anne</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>was portrayed in season two by twin actors <strong>Grace and Amelia Gilmour</strong>.
