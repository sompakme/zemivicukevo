He also called him various names in the process. At the time, the artist found the rant hilarious. According to him, Trick Daddy was simply upset because he had called him a "coke head." Moreover, his response included a hashtag indicating that he'd be using the diss in the intro of his next "Rap Up."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Viral is something that you do accidentally," Trick Daddy said. "Anybody that tries to go viral, you are considered, to me, as a clown. You’re a joke, you’re a fool, you’re a gimmick, you’re a fraud. You catfish. Viral is something that is supposed to happen accidentally unless you’re a content creator, unless you’re an actor, unless you a clown that do magic tricks.” He continued, referring to Uncle Murda as <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">“the No. 1 clown for the last five years.”</a> Now, Uncle Murda's next "Rap Up" is on its way, and as promised, includes part of Trick Daddy's rant.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-uncle-murda-unveils-rap-up-2023-preview>Uncle Murda Unveils "Rap Up 2023" Preview</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this week, Uncle Murda took to social media to tease the annual "Rap Up." He unveiled a new trailer, in which Trick Daddy's "clown" diss <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">takes center stage</a>. “We on the Countdown @trickdaddydollars on the intro&nbsp;#RapUp2023 @greatjohnmusic on the beat by the way,” he captioned the post. In the video, Trick Daddy is heard calling him “the No. 1 clown for the last five years.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Uncle Murda using the audio of Trick Daddy calling him “the No. 1 clown for the last five years" in his "Rap Up 2023" teaser trailer?
