It does not matter who you are, or what your social status is. When love hits, it cannot be stopped.</p><ul><li>Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it.</li></ul><p class=align-left>If there is a circumstance in your life that you dislike, try considering the idea that you have chosen it.

However, there is a catch, you must be in a position to exploit it to your advantage. You can only gain maximally from life's fruits if you train your mind to embrace life positively. Tolle shares his thoughts about how life works in most of his quotes. The ones below are just but a few examples to consider.</p><ul><li>Instead of asking “what do I want from life?” a more powerful question is, “what does life want from me?</li></ul><p class=align-left>You should always look at what life can offer as opposed to what you can offer life.</p><ul><li>Give up defining yourself — to yourself or to others. You won’t die. You can only lose something that you have, but you cannot lose something that you are.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Never worry about what other people think of you. In the same way, forget self-validation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e7212f8b1b696e29.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Viktor Frankl quotes from Man's Search for Meaning</span></p></a><ul><li>In today’s rush we all think too much, seek too much, want too much and forget about the joy of just being</li></ul><p class=align-left>Take a deep breath and enjoy your daily blessings.</p><ul><li>All the things that truly matter — beauty, love, creativity, joy, inner peace — arise from beyond the mind.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Your mind is more powerful than you would dare admit. Anything you perceive in your mind comes to pass.</p><ul><li>Nothing ever happened in the past that can prevent you from being present now, and if the past can’t prevent you from being present now, what power does it have?</li></ul><p class=align-left>Be careful not to be held back by the past. Your present life should not be determined by the past. The past exists only in your mind. Therefore the only power it has in the present moment is the power that you give to it.</p><ul><li>The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but thought about it. Be aware of the thoughts you are thinking. Separate them from the situation, which is always neutral. It is as it is.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a41bc801366d5b66.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Are you a hopeless romantic? 15 signs that say you are</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Often a difficult situation we are in is made much, much worse by our tendency to label and judge it. By remaining detached and being the observer, you can remove the suffering and instead practice acceptance.</p><ul><li>Forget about your life situation and pay attention to your life. Your life situation exists in time, your life is now. Your life situation is mind-stuff, your life is real.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Knowing how to differentiate between life and the situation happening in your life is what determines your real success. The situation is temporary and will always change but your life is real and constant.</p><ul><li>If you both agree that the relationship will be your spiritual practice, so much the better. You can then express your thoughts and feelings to each other as soon as they occur, or as soon as a reaction comes up so that you do not create a time gap in which an unexpressed or unacknowledged emotion or grievance can fester and grow.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/adffaf3da1abd6e9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting John Muir quotes on nature</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Always approach your relationship from a spiritual angle.</p><ul><li>As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease. When you act out the present-moment awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, and love – even the most simple action.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Embracing and accepting the current moment is the secret to all the happiness you need in life.</p><ul><li>What a caterpillar calls the end of the world we call a butterfly.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Every ending of a phase is the beginning of a beautiful chapter.</p><ul><li>Thinking and consciousness are not synonymous. Thinking is only a small aspect of consciousness. Thought cannot exist without consciousness, but consciousness does not need thought.</li></ul><p class=align-left>To be conscious you do not have to think, but for one to think, they must be conscious. Be careful not to mix the two.</p><ul><li>Whenever an answer, a solution, or a creative idea is needed, stop thinking for a moment by focusing attention on your inner energy field. When you resume thinking, it will be fresh and creative.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bd133720e9237204.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top graduation messages for friends</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Every time you need to come up with a lasting solution, make sure that you give yourself time first.</p><ul><li>You are not a problem that needs solving.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Be careful about worrying too much, embrace yourself with all your flaws.</p><p class=align-left>The above mentioned Eckhart Tolle quotes are not only powerful and inspiring but also some of the most thought-provoking ideas you will ever come across.
