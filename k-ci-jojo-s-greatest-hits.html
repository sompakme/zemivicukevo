Along with being the second single off their fourth studio album, Emotional, K-Ci and JoJo scored another slot on a movie soundtrack.&nbsp; Just like “Life” years prior, “This Very Moment” appeared on the soundtrack to the movie, Deliver Us From Eva.&nbsp; <a href=# rel>LL Cool J</a> and Gabrielle Union star in this romantic comedy. &nbsp; This single happened to be the last release for the X singers in 2002 until they came back over ten years later.&nbsp; In 2013, they released “Knock It Off”.&nbsp;</p><span><h2><strong>3. “Last Night’s Letter”</strong></h2></span><p>“Last Night’s Letter” is another wedding ballad for the Jodeci members.&nbsp; Just like “All My Life”, this song can be played during the first dance. It’s an appreciation song for the love of his life.&nbsp; Sometimes, that’s all you need to do, just let her know that you’re thinking of her.&nbsp; K-Ci & Jo-Jo showing us a letter will do the trick.&nbsp;</p><p>Before releasing their hit, “All My Life”, the brothers dropped “Last Night’s Letter”.&nbsp; It was the second single off their debut album, Love Always.&nbsp; On the Billboard R&B/Hip=Hop chart, the song reached number 15.</p><span><h2><strong>2. “Life”</strong></h2></span><p>The R&B duo made a song perfect for the prominent comedy flick, Life, starring Eddie Murphy and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Martin Lawrence</a>.&nbsp; Titled, “Life” as well, the lyrics are right in sync with the plot of the movie.&nbsp; K-CI & JoJo give their all in this performance as you can hear the pain in their voices while singing.&nbsp; It’s as if they really did get a life sentence.&nbsp; You can hear the sorrow as they tell their stories.</p><p>Although this is one of their best songs, the duo did not write it.&nbsp; In fact, <a href=# class=text-word rel>R. Kelly</a> wrote and produced the movie single.&nbsp; It was the first single off the Life soundtrack and first single off K-Ci & JoJo’s second studio album, It’s Real.&nbsp; “Life” peaked at number 60 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.&nbsp; It’s only right that they made a classic song into a classic movie.</p><span><h2><strong>1. "All My Life"</strong></h2></span><p>The perfect wedding song is what K-Ci and JoJo made with “All My Life”.&nbsp; Throughout the song, the duo sings powerful lyrics like “All my life I prayed for someone like you” and “Close to me you’re like my mother, close to me you’re like my father...”.&nbsp; The words in this song certainly scream love and unity.&nbsp; This is one of the best R&B ballads of all time.&nbsp; “All My Life” is a timeless record as this will be played for years to come.</p><p>“All My Life” is the duo’s best record as it topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart three weeks straight!&nbsp; It was nominated for Best R&B song as well as Best R & B Vocal Performance by a Duo Or Group at the 1999 Grammy Awards.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they lost to “Doo Wop (That Thing)” by <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lauryn Hill</a> and “The Boy Is Mine” by <a href=# class=text-word rel>Brandy</a> & Monica, respectively.&nbsp; The video was just as good as the song as it was nominated for Best R&B Video at the MTV Video Music Awards in 19998.&nbsp; Unfortunately, “Gone Till November” by <a href=# class=text-word rel>Wyclef Jean</a> beat them out.&nbsp; Although it did not win awards, the song is a certified classic and their best record.</p><p>Let us know your favorite K-Ci & JoJo song in the comments!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaYVxg5ZmomabmWK3sLbOrGSgqpWWwaa%2F02afoqyj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
