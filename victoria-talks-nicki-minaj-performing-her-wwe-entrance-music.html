Victoria had a couple of different WWE entrance songs along the way.</p><p>The Russian duo t.A.T.u performed Victoria’s famous “All The Things She Said.” After that entrance music was over, the company used “Don’t Mess With” performed by The Hood$tars, Nicki Minaj’s former group.</p><p>While speaking with Chris Van Vliet, she talked about her WWE entrance music and how she didn’t even realize that Nicki Minaj was behind it.</p><p>“I had no clue. When they played the song for me and they played the video, I was like, are you going to have me be a lesbian? They said, no, ‘listen to the words.’ We only owned that for a year. It wasn’t my choice to change.”</p><p>“The next song was from Nicki Minaj but she wasn’t Nicki Minaj at the time. She had a different name. They asked what kind of music I was into and I said hip hop. That’s when they chose that song, ‘I ain’t a lady to mess with’ and they chose that as my entrance.”</p><p>“Years later on Twitter, I found out that it was Nicki Minaj that did my entrance music. I thought it was just a New Yorker. I didn’t know that side of it. We didn’t get to go meet the artists.”</p><p>Victoria hasn’t made a return to WWE, but they might not be allowed to use any of her entrance music either. It seems that the company no longer has an agreement to use it.</p><p>WWE is very picky about the music they give Superstars and it’s always a good thing to own the rights as well. This is one of the reason for<a href=#> all of CFO$’ tracks disappearing in recent memory.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Thanks to<a href=#> Wrestling News</a> for the quote</p><p>December 17, 2020 3:51 pm</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
