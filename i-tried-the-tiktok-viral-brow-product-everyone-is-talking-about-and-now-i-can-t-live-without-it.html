The market is saturated and almost every brand promises to give you the <a class=hm-link href=#>perfect brows</a> whether it's a pencil, gel or pomade, so it takes a really good one to grab my attention.</p><p id=efcx7Kl6sWk data-wc=42>The beauty gurus on <a class=hm-link href=#>TikTok</a> tell me that there's one product that has cut through the noise and it's being labelled "the GOAT" of the brow game. So, is it any good? Spoiler alert: yes. <strong>But here's my honest review on why…</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bd14b332bbe8-img4653.jpg><h2>What is the Byellie Brow Texture?</h2><p id=e5KKnCjpA4W data-wc=47>After being sent the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Byellie 'Brow Texture'</a> and giving it a go for myself, I realised it's essentially like a brow mascara that holds your brows in place. You can use it on its own or as a finishing touch once you've created shape and added colour.</p><p id=e2d3WOH0V-2 data-wc=53>My brows are naturally quite full but, like everyone, I do get the odd gap when I get a bit trigger-happy with the tweezers, so my normal routine is filling in with my humble brow pencil. But I like to finish with a product that fluffs them up and makes them stay put.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="3 questions to ask yourself before buying a beauty product" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/dc4062349fc8-shutterstock1946042902.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="3 questions to ask yourself before buying a beauty product" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>3 questions to ask yourself before buying a beauty product</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Why are we still so judgemental about other women's makeup?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/304f48671da4-kylie-timmy-smile.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Why are we still so judgemental about other women's makeup?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Why are we still so judgemental about other women's makeup?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Need a glow boost?

One end for the primer and the other mascara?).&nbsp;</p><p id=e902PcR8Q6 data-wc=25>Not exactly fond memories, but don't be alarmed, the product dries completely clear. Plus, being able to see how much product you've applied is handy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6f081239c109-byellie-brow-texture.png><p id=etP8yhQisy data-wc=31>It's also really buildable, so if you want more of a 'slick' look then apply away. Equally, it's great for just brushing through gently to keep any pesky flyaways in check.</p><h2>Why is the Brow Texture so good and would I buy it?</h2><p id=el3c55ONJLc data-wc=53>Yes! After the 'Brow Texture' had dried, my brows did not budge all day and night. I mean it. They didn't move. It's like a hairspray for your brows and I was truly impressed. It's so easy to use, does the job and, frankly, that's enough for me to be a big fan.</p><p id=ewnusnSqCb data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Want eyebrows like Lily Collins?

It's economical as well. I've been using one tube since the end of November and I don't see it running out anytime soon, and I wear it most days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4ee0efe9ff6e-img4681.jpg><h2>What else is there to know about Byellie?</h2><p id=eooi1M8WlMl data-wc=37>If you're familiar with Byellie, you'll likely know that their selling point is that their products offer a 'laminated brow' effect at a fraction of the cost. <strong>Their hero product,&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Byellie 'Brow Shape'</a><strong>, does this in spades.</strong></p><p id=eACGRH7sMaa data-wc=41>The 'Brow Shape' is a pot of gel that you dip your brow brush into before applying it to brows. It gives a full-on slicked-down finish, making it look like you've stepped out of the salon fresh from a brow lamination.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/138abf36c777-byellie-brow-shape.png><p id=ef-k0djkEaa data-wc=38>Beauty lovers who are big fans of this look are more than impressed by this product – and it does exactly what it says it does. However, for me, a laminated effect wouldn't be my desired brow style.</p><p id=enWihzj9MJF data-wc=35>I personally prefer a more natural, fluffy and textured brow, but one that is still going to hold its shape. And for that reason, the 'Brow Texture' will remain a staple in my makeup bag.</p><p id=eSdA-LyvWo data-wc=13><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Subscribe to HELLO!'s Beauty Collective newsletter</a><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGxqaWZlfnDAyKSrqKNdq7azrctmmaunp2K9s7vDrpqtZZWrsrPFzqecZqyRobiqusZmmJunpal6rsWMoaannaOperW0zq6eoayjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
