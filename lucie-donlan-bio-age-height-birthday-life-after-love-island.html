She thought of herself as distinct from other girls on the show in that she not only loves to look glam but is also sporty. She also stood out as one who enjoys the company of guys rather than girls.</p><p class=align-left>Lucie Rose <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">has dated</a> various people from <i>Love Island</i>. She previously dated Charlie Frederick, a contestant in the show’s fourth season.

The <i>Love Island</i> stars would post multiple photos together on their Instagram pages. The relationship was rocky, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">they split up</a>, reunited, and then split up again after "growing apart."</p><p class=align-left>Currently, <i>Love Island</i> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Lucie is dating</a> Luke Mabbott since July 2020. They somehow found their way to each other even though they didn't appear on the show together. The lovebirds got together from chatting on Instagram during the lockdown period.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a8f21eb0a7a6eb30.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Leanna Bartlett biography: age, measurements, net worth, movies</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d123ad56c99fee68.jpg><p class=align-left>Luke was a finalist on the sixth season of <i>Love Island</i>.
