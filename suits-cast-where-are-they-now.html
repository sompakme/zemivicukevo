Initially titled “A Legal Mind,” the pilot, written by series creator <a href=#>Aaron Korsh</a>, was picked up by <a href=#>USA Network</a> on Jan, 19, 2011, with a 12-episode order that included a 90-minute premiere.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Greenlighting the <a href=#>legal series </a>centered on the employees at the fictional Pearson Hardman law firm in New York City marked a greater expansion into drama series for USA, which at the time was running its popular “Characters Welcome” slogan, signifying its diverse lineup of programming. The investment paid off. Suits would go on to air for nine seasons and even spawned a short-lived spinoff titled Pearson, based on <a href=#>Gina Torres’</a> character Jessica Pearson’s foray into Chicago politics. The new series premiered July 17, 2019, during the final season of Suits, which concluded Sept. 25, 2019.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">USA canceled Pearson after one season and not much was thought of Harvey Specter (<a href=#>Gabriel Macht</a>), Mike Ross (<a href=#>Patrick J. Adams</a>) or the rest of the characters at the firm afterward. However, when <a href=#>Netflix</a> added seasons one through eight of Suits to its streaming platform in June, it sparked a surge of <a href=#>renewed interest</a> in the drama which, as of Oct. 5, has broken <a href=#>Nielsen’s all-time overall streaming record</a> by remaining in the No. 1 spot for 12 straight weeks. (Season nine of Suits is currently streaming on <a href=#>Peacock</a> along with Pearson, and <a href=#>a companion series is in the works </a>at NBCUniversal.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In honor of <a href=#>Suits’ resurgence, </a>The Hollywood Reporter takes a look at how the castmembers of this popular show got their start in Hollywood and what they’ve been up to since the series ended.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Gabriel Macht as Harvey Reginald Specter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1-Gabriel-Macht-Split-Getty-H-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Gabriel Macht landed his first role at the age of 8 in the 1980 comedy-drama Why Would I Lie?, for which he received a nomination for the best young motion picture actor award from the Young Artist Foundation.
