The inspiration behind the shoot was the 67th Cannes International Film Festival poster, which features a photo of <strong>Marcello Mastroianni</strong> from <strong>Federico </strong><strong>Fellini</strong>’s 1963 film&nbsp;8½.</p><p>“I thought it would be interesting to see two different sides of Ellen Page: one as a very chic Italian movie director, and the other as an homage to the French and Italian ingenues of that time.”</p><p><a href=#><span><strong>STORY: ‘X-Men’s’ Ellen Page on Life After Coming Out, the <a href=# id=auto-tag_bryan-singer data-tag=bryan-singer>Bryan Singer</a> Case and Her Battle With Depression</strong></span></a></p><p>Page, who plays Kitty Pride in X-Men: Days of Future Past&nbsp;(out May 23), donned an array of clothes for the shoot reflecting both men’s and women’s wear that were inspired by <strong>Jane </strong><strong>Seberg</strong>‘s character in <strong>Jean-Luc </strong><strong>Godard</strong>‘s Breathless.</p><p>The actress, however, was candid in her interview with THR senior writer&nbsp;<strong>Seth Abramovitch</strong> and did not hold back about her hatred of dresses: “I would rather be in boy underwear with my hands on my tits,” she confessed.</p><p>Watch video from the shoot below:</p><p><a href=#><span><strong>Photos: ‘X-Men’s’ Ellen Page: Her Career in Pictures</strong></span></a></p><p>Photographer <strong>Olivia Malone</strong> captured the actress in three pockets of the Ace: the 1927 United Artists Theater, the cafe and a hotel suite. When asked why THR chose the cover shot, Laski commented that the photo embodied glamor (hair and makeup), a Parisian feel (striped T-shirt) and risk (Page looking away from the camera). “I think there’s something about this pensive moment of Ellen in this very pivotal stage of her life — she just looks beautiful,”&nbsp;Laski said, adding, “It was a very quiet shoot…this is just her. We weren’t making her do anything.”</p><p><a href=#><span><strong>VIDEO: Ellen Page: Coming Out Gave Me ‘Freedom’ to Wear Jeans, T-Shirt</strong></span></a></p><p>In the May 16 issue feature, Page opens up about battling depression, her X-Men director <strong>Bryan Singer</strong>’s alleged under-age sex scandal and life since coming out. The actress made her public declaration on Valentine’s Day in Las Vegas at the Time to Thrive social-welfare seminar for LGBT youth, where five minutes into her speech she announced: “I am here today because I am gay.”</p><p>“I knew I would be happier,” Page told THR.&nbsp;“But I wouldn’t have anticipated just how f—ing happy I am and how every tiny little aspect of my life feels better.”</p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Embeds/Ellen_Page_17_Cover_html.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKa4y56lZqiRnLK0ecKapaedo2KwsMLEq2ScqpWWwarCxGZuaWphboJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
