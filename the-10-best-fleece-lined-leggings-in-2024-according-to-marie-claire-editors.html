Some are thin enough to layer under the rest of your clothes, with many not being much thicker than your regular pair of black leggings. Fleece-lined leggings from universally adored&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g32369050/best-activewear-brands/>athleisure brands</a>&nbsp;like Alo Yoga and Lululemon, for instance, look just as sleek as their standard stretchy alternatives. Plus, the majority of the options on this list retail for under $50. Stay warm!</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for-in-fleece-lined-leggings><span>What to Look For in Fleece-Lined Leggings</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Materials: </strong>Choosing the best fabric for your fleece-lined leggings depends on when you plan to wear your pair. Are they for cozy lounging on the couch? Errand-running on brisk winter days? Early-morning runs when the sun has yet to fully rise?&nbsp;For instance, nylon and polyester are known to be breathable and sweat-wicking, which makes them ideal for movement and exercise. Cotton, on the other hand, retains moisture (a.k.a. don't wear cotton leggings if you have a high-sweat activity on the docket) but offers extreme softness and comfort. Some ultra-stretchy fabrics like spandex, elastane, and lycra are perfect for active days when you'd like your leggings to shape and support your figure.</li><li><strong>Comfort: </strong>While the main draw of fleece-lined leggings is their warmth, you want to ensure they're comfortable, too. If the pair is too tight for your liking, consider sizing up for a less snug fit. Or if the fleece lining feels itchy on your skin or perhaps it's too warm, to the point that your legs are sweating all day, opt for a more breathable and lightweight interior pair.</li><li><strong>Design features: </strong><a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g34975882/leggings-with-pockets/>Leggings with pockets</a>, zippered pouches, foot stirrups, or eye-catching waistlines—the design features are endless in activewear. As you shop, consider if you'd like your fleece leggings to have any bonus details that will offer helpful functionality or a little flair.</li><li><strong>Style: </strong>Leggings are fundamental to the modern wardrobe. There are so many ways to <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/how-to-wear-leggings-in-2023/>style leggings</a> for the season ahead, and fleece-lined leggings are no different. The options on this list are just as easy to style as the other leggings in your wardrobe—many of them come in neutral colors and won't add bulk.</li></ul><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-fleece-lined-leggings-according-to-fashion-editors><span>The Best Fleece-Lined Leggings, According to Fashion Editors</span></h2><p>We ranked the below pairs as the best fleece-lined leggings based on their versatility, quality, high proportion of five-star reviews, customer feedback, and size range.</p><a href=# data-model-name="Baleaf Fleece Lined Winter Leggings " data-url=https://www.amazon.com/INESVER-Winter-Leggings-Thermal-Workout/dp/B09LHWWT1V referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FINESVER-Winter-Leggings-Thermal-Workout%2Fdp%2FB09LHWWT1V%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K5Q6DjceRcYddcpGKidEQd-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Overall Fleece-Lined Leggings</span></p></a><p>Baleaf Fleece Lined Winter Leggings</p><p>"Reviewers on Amazon love these fleece-lined leggings, which have nearly 17,000 five-star reviews," says <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/julia-marzovilla/>E-Commerce Editor J</a><a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/julia-marzovilla/>ulia Marzovilla</a> as to why this particular pair initially caught her eye.
