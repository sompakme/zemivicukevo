They saw everything. I might as well have lifted up my skirt for them.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe at the London ‘Les Mis’ Premiere</a></strong></p><p>On Wednesday, Hathway went on the offensive to criticize those who took and distributed the embarrassing photographs during an appearance on <a href=# id=auto-tag_today data-tag=today>Today</a>.</p><p>At the start of her interview, <strong>Matt Lauer</strong> cracked, “We’ve seen a lot of you lately,” to which the witty star replied, “Sorry about that. I’d be happy to stay home, but, the film.”</p><p>Hathaway went on to describe the incident as “unfortunate” and said that it made her “sad” for two very big reasons.</p><p>“I was very sad that we live in an age when someone takes a picture of someone in a vulnerable moment and rather than delete it and do the decent thing, sells it,” she said. “And I’m sorry that we live in a culture that commodifies sexuality of unwilling participants, which brings us back to Les Mis, because that’s what my character is. She’s someone who is forced to sell sex to benefit her child because she has nothing and there’s no social safety net.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>THR COVER: Inside the Fight To Bring ‘Les Mis’ To The Screen</a></strong></p><p>And just like that, Hathaway, a true professional, directed the interview away from the personal incident and back toward the film she was on hand to promote.</p><p>The actress went on to discuss her preparations to play Fantine (including sobbing in the bathroom at her home), and why she avoids discussing her 25-pound weight loss.</p><p>Visit NBCNews.com for <a href=# rel=nofollow>breaking news</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>world news</a>, and <a href=# rel=nofollow>news about the economy</a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOmqWnnV2drrW0wLCYsmWjoa6uv4ywmKucoqSvpnnMmqOfrZ6Ywaq7zWZraWlkbYRw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
