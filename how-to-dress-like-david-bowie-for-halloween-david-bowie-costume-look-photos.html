You don't half-ass Starman. The devil is always in the celestial details.</p><p>So when I decided to do my own interpretation of Ziggy Stardust this year, I wanted to execute it with great precision—but, in true ever-evolving Bowie fashion—express myself while I was at it.</p><p>Marrying obsessive research with my own penchant for far-out beauty and style, here's what I learned is essential to becoming The Thin White Duke.</p><p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>You need to make your brows disappear.&nbsp;</strong>Step one to becoming an androgynous alien rock star? Shave your brows—it makes your practically unrecognizable. While I will do many things for the sake of art, I'm not that bold…so I bleached them instead. I visited Larry Raspanti at&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://whittemorehousesalon.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Whittemore House</a>, the go-to salon for color backstage at Marc Jacobs and Alexander Wang.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XRJVnhKPKU7AWxVDXqX6pk-1920-80.gif><p>Raspanti used Whittemore House Hair Paint, a natural lightening powder, on my thick, dark brown arches for 30 minutes. After they turned a bright, yellowish white, he toned them down with a demi-permanent stain for a translucent effect. Then voilà, they were as good as gone.</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;The flame-hued mullet is also a must.&nbsp;</strong>Bowie's signature hairstyle was the brainchild of himself alongside Suzi Ronson, a 21-year-old hairdresser who loved rock 'n' roll. (At the time, it was uncommon for a woman to cut a man's hair.) The pair was inspired by a model for designer Kansai Yamamoto, and the rest is history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aJoVE89RpsZ8yUkBmkjvhN-1920-80.gif><p>Because my hair is naturally curly, the mullet is not something I could commit to permanently. The same goes for the orange-red hair dye. So I went to Bumble and bumble's downtown salon where their stylists transformed a long, blonde human hair wig. Since there was no heat from the scalp, Bb.colorist Luis Ayala used a more intense dye than normal to acheive Bowie's signature shade. Then, stylist Mischa G created the layered, high-low 'do with thinning sheers for a soft, feathered cut.

One of my biggest takeaways was that Bowie loved highlighter just as much as the Instagram generation…if not more.</p><p>"For stage, David will often use an iridescent base, usually pure white," the magazine reports. "Once in awhile he uses pearlized gloss on his lips in a tan/pink that comes across like a white-silver highlight."</p><p>For extra shine, Bowie would look to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://bit.ly/2fACsC0 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Elizabeth Arden's Eight Hour Cream</a>. According to the article it's "what you'll see shining up David's lips and eyelids in photographs, it gives that extra-gloss effect."</p><p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>You must contour your face like it's never been contoured before.&nbsp;</strong>"He has the perfect face for makeup," explained Pierre LaRoche, Bowie's makeup artist, in 1973. "He has even features, high cheekbones and a very good mouth." Because of Bowie's naturally pronounced bone structure and super-svelte physique, contouring was one of the most important aspects of achieving his look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6GUAmX9UmJWWAqTvyWdGrF-1920-80.png><p>Obviously, this was a job for a seasoned pro, so I looked to Make Up For Ever artist Alice An, who not only shadowed my entire face, but then draped my blush à la Bowie for even further sunken-in cheekbones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MbUoR3AhmcpudtakCbExoe-1920-80.gif><p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>The eyes have it.</strong>&nbsp;The way I see it, with his glam rock aesthetic, Bowie rocked '80s makeup&nbsp;in the '70s. In addition to statement blush, he also loved painting different shades of blue around the eyes and adding dimension with metallics.</p><p>This could be best scene in his "Life On Mars?" music video, which is what we worked off of for the beauty look in its entirety.</p><p>"David will often paint waves of color all the way across his eyes and eyebrows, rather than on the lids only," revealed&nbsp;Music Scene.</p><p><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>You can put your own spin on his style.&nbsp;</strong>At first I had my heart set on recreating one of his costumes to a tee, but that was proving challenging. Thankfully upon attending the magical theatrical production that was the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/news/a23183/kenzo-hm-runway-show/>Kenzo x H&M runway show</a>, I fell in love with one of the looks: A red-and-black, zebra-print skintight turtleneck and skinny pants set. It screamed Bowie to me—especially because he was so partial to Japanese design.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9VkF2KVvs9PPxH4CnCSvSZ-1920-80.jpg><p>To accessorize, I paired the getup with a steel blue feather boa and Jeffrey Campbell's silver lace-up platform "Avenger" boots. Jewelry-wise, I had an ear cuff with crystal stars going down the side in one ear, and then two spider-shaped studs with red rhinestones for the Spiders from Mars.</p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;You need to top things off with talons.&nbsp;</strong>Bowie loved nail polish, painting his digits everything from shimmery gold to metallic navy. When I realized that one of my favorite songs of his, and all time, "Rebel, Rebel" would spell out perfectly on each of my hands, I ran with it. I showed a nail artist at&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://www.vanityprojectsnyc.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Vanity Projects</a>&nbsp;the red, white, and blue cover art and she ran with it.
