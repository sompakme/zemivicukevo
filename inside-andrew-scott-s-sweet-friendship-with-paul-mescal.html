During an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Esquire</a> in August, Paul quoted Andrew, who told him: "The only thing you're left with after love is grief. Which is, like, a bleak thing, but I think it's just a fact."</p><p id=eIYYhvnKOUCL data-wc=38>Currently, Paul and Andrew have no plans to reunite on the screen yet, but we hope to see the double act together again in the future, whether that be on the red carpet or in another hit film.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
