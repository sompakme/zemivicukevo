The second single off their 1995 self-titled debut, "I'll Stick Around" was the first Foo Fighters song that had its own accompanying&nbsp;<a href=#>video</a>, and it was helmed by Devo bassist Gerald Casale, who was then enjoying success in his second career as a music video director.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking to Rock Classics Radio on Apple Music Hits, Casale revealed several details about the "I'll Stick Around"&nbsp;video, including its most distinctive element, the "menacing ball" that could be seen floating around the Foos as they perform. According to Casale, the ball represented none other than Courtney Love, and it was his idea to include it after he figured out who the song's insistent refrain was referring to. "When I heard the song, I immediately assumed that what Dave is talking about when he said, 'I don't owe you anything' and knowing the problems they were going through with Courtney, I made the assumption, it was about Courtney," he explained, as quoted by <a href=#>Loudwire</a>.</p><p>Casale also recalled talking to Dave Grohl about the lyrics and trying to get confirmation whether or not "I'll&nbsp;Stick Around" was about the Hole frontwoman. According to the musician-turned-director, Grohl wouldn't confirm or deny anything, so he "just rolled with it" and used the floating ball as symbolism for Love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j2luanFnZMGpsYyfpqhllp60qcDEq6pmrpmZsrB506GYrWWVrb2zsdKsnJ1lkaO0pr6MraawmaKZeqS71Kurp52pYrmwwsRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
