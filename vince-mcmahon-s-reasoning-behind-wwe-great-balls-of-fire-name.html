This includes the very bizarre booking and naming decisions that have taken place in WWE over the years, including the Great Balls Of Fire name for the Premium Live Event.</p><p>The WWE Great Balls Of Fire Premium Live Event took place on Sunday 9th July 2017 from the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas and featured quite a few notable bouts.</p><p>However, all of that was overshadowed by the name of the Premium Live Event itself. After all, fans and pro wrestlers alike simply could not understand why anyone would name an event like that.</p><p>While speaking on a recent edition of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Extreme Life Of Matt Hardy</a>, Matt Hardy talked about the Great Balls Of Fire event and confirmed that it was entirely Vince McMahon’s idea, as he was a fan of Jerry Lewis.</p><p>“I think the general consensus among the talent was huh? Whenever they heard Great Balls of Fire was the name of the event. It is what it is. [Matt is asked if it’s a Vince-ism] I mean, it’s gotta be. He’s a big Jerry Lewis fan apparently. For real, not not joking. I’m pretty sure, like that song. He loves that song, that was one of his favourites.”</p><p>Almost 17,000 fans were in attendance in Texas as Brock Lesnar successfully retained his WWE Universal Championship against Samoa Joe in a thrilling contest. Regardless, it is highly unlikely WWE will ever bring back that event ever again.</p><p>What’s your view on this Vince McMahon story? Are you surprised by it?
