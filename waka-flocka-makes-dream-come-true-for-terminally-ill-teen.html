After she answered the door, Lyles screamed in his face due to sheer excitement.</p><p>Apparently Waka had gotten wind of Kiyana's plight, and, hearing that her dream was to one day meet him, hooked up with the Make-A-Wish Foundation to make her dream come true. In addition to spending a genuine amount of time with Kiyana, Waka also signed a CD and invited her to attend a concert of his in Columbus, Ga.</p><p>"It really put things into perspective for me," Waka said of his experience with the sick teen. "People just don't know what is to come, or when that day is. Family is the most important thing, and being able to make a difference while you're here. I was put here for a reason. We all were, feel me? All we can do is better ourselves and help others."<br>Also in attendance were Kiyana's mother, stepfather, half-brother and grandmother, and several reps from the foundation.</p><p>In other Waka news, the rapper is said to be prepping the follow-up to his 2010 debut 'Flockaveli.' The new album, titled 'Triple F Life: Friends, Fans, & Family,' is expected to drop later this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdja312edaaoppllqG8pLfAZqSao5WoeqW%2BxJqkZpuforJuwNGunGaen6d6tbHRpqCnmZyhxm61y6VkrZ2Vo3qvsdas</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
