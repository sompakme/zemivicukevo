Over 15 years my relationship with Sherilyn has been hostile and I have tried to deal with a narcissist person. Not only myself but close friends of Sherilyn of over 10 years and family have cut ties with her because of her manic behaviors. I tried to do therapy with Sherilyn but she always said NO and that I am sick not her. Sherilyn please tell your side of your character of being drunk on the cruise and having guys in your room then crying because you think you were raped then demanded us to go to a pharmacy in Bahamas for Plan B. You want to play dirty and sling Kris and I thru the mud….I have my own pile of mud FROM YOU.</p><p>Are you enjoying the 2 cars that Kris bought you, the 3 apartments you bailed out of, and the 2 surgeries we paid for you. Your lies will catch up and I feel bad for you.</p><p>Sherilyn, not once have you spoken to Kris about the situation, but you can go on social media and tell all….but that’s how you communicate….another example of you manipulating and harassing others.</p><p>I am so done with you and tired of the years of your manipulation, lies, and disrespect. I kept quiet for years because you never seeked therapy to learn how to have an adult conversation with me. It has always been your way or nothing at all.</p><p>Ok Sherilyn, not only will I see you in court but you and I will no longer be related.</p><p>For the fans who feel entitled to comment…F*CK YOU….you hear one side of a story, and you feel entitled to comment on something you know nothing about.”</p><p>However, if one were to visit <a href=#>Vickie’s Instagram account now</a>, they would notice that all previous posts, including the denial statement, have been removed.</p><p>The account has undergone a complete rebranding, now representing ‘Travel by Vickie.’ The bio welcomes visitors to the page and highlights Vickie’s love for traveling, offering to create detailed itineraries for business or personal trips.</p><p>Currently, there are only three posts on the account: one promoting an all-inclusive resort in Punta Cana with a “book now, save 60%” offer, one displaying a certificate confirming Vickie’s completion of the Evolution Travel Academy’s Travel 101 Course, and one showcasing the ‘Travel by Vickie’ logo.</p><p>Following Sherilyn’s allegations, <a href=#>Vickie was removed from AEW’s official roster page</a> on their website. Her contract with the promotion was set to expire in July, and she had already stated that she would not be re-signing.</p><p>As the situation continues to develop, Vickie Guerrero’s social media rebranding suggests a shift in focus towards her new venture, ‘Travel by Vickie,’ as she navigates the aftermath of the allegations made by her daughter.</p><p>What are your thoughts on Vickie Guerrero’s decision to rebrand her social media account?
