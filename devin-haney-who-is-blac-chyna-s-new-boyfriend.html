Chyna has already moved on with another young boyfriend, hooking up with boxer Devin Haney.</p><p>If young is a type, that’s Chyna’s type for sure. Her last boyfriend was just a teenager and Devin Haney is too, at just 19 years old.</p><p>It’s not clear how Blac Chyna and Devin Haney met. Bravo pointed out that they have the same lawyer so they very well could have crossed paths that way.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, Chyna and her new boo have been dating for months. Was she dating the boxer and her former rapper boyfriend at the same time? That may just serve him right since there are rumors that Jay got another woman pregnant while he was dating Chyna.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bkp53YuHHoO/?hl=en&taken-by=realdevinhaney</p><p>While Devin may be young, he’s clearly a rising star. The teenage boxer is mentored by boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. and like his predecessor, Devin is undefeated.</p><p>Devin boasts a boxing record of 19 wins, 13 knockouts and has never lost an official boxing match. The San Francisco native is just 5-feet-9-inches tall but has been hailed as an up-and-coming boxer whose career is worth watching.</p><p>One thing that is pretty interesting about Devin Haney is that his nickname is The Dream. That could get confusing since Chyna’s daughter with Rob Kardashian is named Dream.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/blacchyna.jpg><p>Fans of the boxing star were horrified when Blac Chyna popped up in the comments of a recent photo on Instagram. After she wrote “Hi babe” followed with a trophy emoji in the comments of one picture, many of his followers begged Devin to ditch his much older girlfriend before she gets her hands on his money.</p><p>Currently, reports of Devin Haney’s net worth show him to be worth around $400,000. However, he’s clearly on the rise and his career is starting to take off.</p><p>It’s no secret how much a top-billed boxer can make. Is Blac Chyna investing her time in this teenager in hopes of a huge payoff later? Many think not considering how short most of her relationships end up being.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6cnKWdkqe2tcWOnZyvoZ5itaK6xLJksKCfYra0ecGlmJxlk53Gr63SZqWer12XvLqy0aKcp5xf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
