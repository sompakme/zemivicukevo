Henson has been making headlines in recent weeks for raising issues with the way cast members were treated while working on The Color Purple. Countless fans and peers have chimed into the conversation, noting how Black women in the entertainment industry have always been treated unfairly, and undervalued by their white and male counterparts. Amid the discourse, various users have also noted how <a href=# rel>Mo'Nique raised similar concerns</a> to Henson's years back, though hers weren't recognized nearly enough at the time.</p><p>During a recent Golden Globes interview, Oprah Winfrey chimed in on the controversy surrounding The Color Purple, which she co-produced. “Everything got handled,” she said of issues on set. “It’s so disturbing to me because why is my name even in this conversation? <a href=# rel>I’ve been the champion for everybody.</a>” Mo'Nique has now responded to Oprah's comments, however, and she thinks otherwise.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Oprah Will Interview Taraji P.

I’m Oprah Winfrey.'" She went on, noting how the issues raised should have been handled before the women stepped on set. “You know everything should have been done when you showed up…Now when you hear our beautiful sisters saying, ‘yeah but it got fixed,’ it’s like we’re making it worse.”</p><p>“So, when Oprah Winfrey sits at the helm and Taraji P. Henson says, ‘It’s an honor that we were hand-picked for this movie,’ Well, if they were hand-picked for that movie, <a href=# rel>those women should have been taken care of from the moment go</a>.” What do you think of Mo'Nique finally speaking out following Taraji P.
