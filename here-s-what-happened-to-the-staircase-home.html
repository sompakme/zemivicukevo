According to <a href=#>Realtor</a>, homes that were the site of notorious killings can lose between 10 and 25% of their value, and sellers face an uphill battle getting anyone to buy the house even at lower rates.

Per The News & Observer, the North Carolina home was initially listed at $1.175 million after he was sentenced. The price was reduced later that year to $975,000, but when it finally sold in 2004, it went for $640,000, almost half the original asking price. The buyer was&nbsp;Jason Balius, the owner of a local bakery.</p><p>Balius didn't hold onto the Peterson house for long. In 2007, after renovations, he put it up for sale and found a buyer within a year: Biond Fury, a New York-based psychic,&nbsp;who purchased the house for $1.3 million. The house stayed with Fury for over a decade, during which time he briefly tried raising money through GoFundMe for further renovations. In 2020, the house was back on the market. Realtor reported that a limited liability company acquired the house for $1.6 million that year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k2xvaW9oZMSprdNmn5qooJq7prCMrKuaoaKYrrSxjKGmpp1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
