While&nbsp;Channel Orange&nbsp;served as his debut, fans&nbsp;had to wait four long years for&nbsp;Blonde, which made its final arrival much sweeter than it might have been otherwise. Although both are&nbsp;widely regarded as high quality bodies of work, most fans typically prefer one over the other, even if only by a little.</p><p>Jason Merritt/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Among those fans are the woman who birthed the artist: Frank's mother, Katonya. On Wednesday, Katonya was asked by&nbsp;poet and writer, AJ Addae,&nbsp;during an interview over&nbsp;Instagram live which of her son's two albums she prefers more. Like so many of Frank's most diehard supporters, Katonya was able to finally settle on one, but it wasn't without some major hesitation and internal debate.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Blonde.&nbsp;No wait. They were&nbsp;both so good, this is crazy," Katonya noted, struggling to choose.&nbsp;"But I will&nbsp;probably say&nbsp;Blonde.&nbsp;I love 'Pink +&nbsp;White.' OK,&nbsp;Blonde."</p><p>Larry Busacca/Getty Images for TIME</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Why&nbsp;Blonde?"&nbsp;AJ pressed. Katonya went on to name all the songs she loves off&nbsp;Blonde&nbsp;in response.&nbsp;"Because I love 'Pink + White' and Beyonc√©'s on 'Pink + White,'"&nbsp;she&nbsp;explained. "And I love 'Nights,' oh my god...and oh 'White Ferrari!'"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">AJ tweeted that she'll be transcribing the full interview and printing it in the May issue of her monthly newsletter, which is dropping in a few days.
