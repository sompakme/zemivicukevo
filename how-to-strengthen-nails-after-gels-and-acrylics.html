Zero dry time, long wear with no chips, perpetually glossy shine, and, in the case of acrylics, even longer length. But all of these types of manis come with the potential to take a major toll on your nails (particularly if they're removed improperly).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your weak, brittle nails are in need of a little extra TLC, listen up. We've rounded up pro tips from celebrity manicurists and nail experts (including their go-to nail strengtheners and supplements) to help your nails grow stronger and longer.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tip-1-remove-polish-correctly></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tip #1: Remove Polish Correctly</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Okay, so technically this isn't a repair tip, but do this first and it can save you from having to deal with a lot of potential problems. First and foremost, repeat after us: I will not pick off a gel manicure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Picking off gel is probably the worst thing you can do to your nails," says celebrity manicurist Geraldine Holford. "The immediate effects are harming the nail plate because you're removing the top layers of the actual nail along with your polish," she explains. "The long-term effects are thinning of the nails, harm to the nail bed, and irregularities on the nail plate and in growth patterns." ORLY's Senior Product Testing Manager, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Kelly Bannon</a> agrees, adding that even if you soak your nails to remove the polish, you can still damage your nails if not soaked long enough or if the topcoat barrier is not broken, prohibiting the removal to reach all the gel layers. She strongly recommends having your gels removed by a professional to prevent any damage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pro tip: Whether you're having gel or dip removed, ask your tech to cover your hands in hot towels while your nails are wrapped up in the acetone-soaked cotton pads; the heat will help speed up the process, explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sarah Gibson Tuttle</a>, founder and CEO of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Olive & June</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can try <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>removing dips</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>gels at home</a>, but definitely save acrylic removal for the pros since the adhesive used is much stronger — as is your potential to do major damage. "Improper removal, in this case, is ten times worse than it is with gels. It really has to be careful and thoughtful, and should take up to two hours," notes Tuttle.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tip-2-hydrate-your-nails></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tip #2: Hydrate Your Nails</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now that the gel-dip-acrylic is off, the key is to moisturize, moisturize, moisturize. "Prolonged use of gel manis and acrylics dehydrates your nails, making them dry, brittle, and fragile," says manicurist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Jin Soon Choi</a>, founder of JINsoon nail polish and salons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cuticle oil is your BFF for imparting deep hydration. Focus on slathering it not only on the nail itself but also massaging it well into the cuticle. The cuticle is where new, healthy nail growth will start so it's important to nourish and hydrate this area, says Choi.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One best-seller to try: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>CND Solar Oil Nail and Cuticle Conditioner</a>. Holford also likes using straight-up <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>jojoba oil</a>, which can strengthen nail beds and boost healthy nail growth. She recommends applying it three times per day for five days (and keeping nails otherwise bare) for the best results.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tip-3-give-nails-a-break></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tip #3: Give Nails a Break</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"While there's no scientific evidence that keeping your nails polish-free will make a difference, anecdotally I can tell you that we totally notice a difference in the strength and health of the nails when our clients do take a break," says Tuttle. Choi and Holford agree — all three recommend keeping your nails au naturel for at least a few days after sporting a gel, acrylics, or dip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you really need to keep them polished, use a nail strengthener as a base coat, suggests Holford. You can also look for a color that contains strengthening ingredients. (Keep reading for a list of some of our favorites below.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tip-4-consider-going-shorter></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tip #4: Consider Going Shorter</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Whether you realize it or not, when you have long nails you're constantly hitting them on your keyboard, the door, you name it. People underestimate how much of an impact this has," says Tuttle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep your nails short and give them a chance to grow out stronger and healthier (and heck, maybe even longer) than before. The other upshot: Nails that aren't in great shape look healthier when they're shorter, adds Holford.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bannon adds that giving yourself a mini "manicure" — even if it's just as simple as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>filing your nails</a> — every two to four days can prevent breakage and snags. If your nails are really in need of some T.L.C., repeat these manis for two to four weeks to see results and stronger nails.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tip-5-strengthen-from-the-inside-out></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tip #5: Strengthen From the Inside Out</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Along with addressing nails from the outside, all the experts we spoke with agreed that the right supplements can help strengthen your tips from the inside out. One good option? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Collagen</a>. An essential protein for hair, skin, and nails, ingestible collagen peptides are easily incorporated into your daily routine and can help promote healthy nails.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Collagen has really made a difference in the health of my nails. They feel resilient and stronger," says Holford. Try <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>NeoCell Super Collagen Powder</a>. Another good option? <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Biotin</a>. The B vitamin is one of Tuttle's top picks for strengthening nails. Choi adds that along with supplements, you can also incorporate biotin-rich and collagen-synthesizing foods — salmon, avocados, sweet potatoes, leafy greens, nuts, and seeds — into your diet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: It's Going To Be All About the Almond Nails This Summer</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tip-6-apply-a-nail-strengthener></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tip #6: Apply a Nail Strengthener</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Orly Nailtrition</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bannon recommends ending those aforementioned mini manicures with two coats of Orly's Nailtrition to strengthen damaged nails and promote growth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$15; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>orlybeauty.com</a></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Essie Treat Love & Color Nail Polish Strengthener</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If the idea of sporting bare nails is simply unfathomable, this line from Essie is a solid choice.
