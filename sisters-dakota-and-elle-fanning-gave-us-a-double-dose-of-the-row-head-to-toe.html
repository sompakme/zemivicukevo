We’re very different, but we’re very connected. We don’t talk every day, but we don’t have to.

That dynamic is so special and unique. They know your family more than anybody. She [Dakota] is my closest person.”</p><p>In addition to coordinating fashion looks, the two are partners in business, with plans to bring<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://ew.com/tv/paris-hilton-tv-series-elle-and-dakota-fanning-a24/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>Paris Hilton’s memoir</u></a> to the small screen soon. “All we did was play Simple Life growing up,” Elle told<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/arts/elle-fanning-broadway-debut-appropriate-the-great-1235712346/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none> <u>The Hollywood Reporter</u></a>, referring to Hilton’s reality show with friend Nicole Richie. “Dakota was Paris, and I was always Nicole.”&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
