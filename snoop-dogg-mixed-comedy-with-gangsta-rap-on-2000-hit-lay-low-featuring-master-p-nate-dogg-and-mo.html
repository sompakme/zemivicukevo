It was released on this day 23 years ago. Today, we wanted to shed light on a funny but also serious West Coast groove from it. "Lay Low" saw <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Snoop assemble</a> a tremendous cast of artists and producers for a rowdy banger.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-lay-low-by-snoop-dogg-master-p-nate-dogg-butch-cassidy-and-tha-eastsidaz>Listen To "Lay Low" By Snoop Dogg, <a href=# class=text-word>Master P</a>, <a href=# class=text-word>Nate Dogg</a>, Butch <a href=# class=text-word>Cassidy</a>, And Tha Eastsidaz</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It features the likes of legends Master P, Nate Dogg, as well as Butch Cassidy and Tha Eastsidaz. Additionally, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Dr. Dre</a> is in the mix behind the board and on the mic. He kicks the track with a spoken word bit before one of the greatest hook writers comes in. Nate brings gnarly but admittedly quite amusing lyrics to the table. The beat has that familiar West Coast/G-funk style that hits heavy. Revisit the track with the link above.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What were your initial thoughts on "Lay Low," by Snoop Dogg featuring Master P, Nate Dogg, Tha Eastsidaz, and Butch Cassidy?
