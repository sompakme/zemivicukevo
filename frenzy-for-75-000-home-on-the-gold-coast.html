My phone has just gone ballistic ...</p><p>"I have had at least 50 calls and from interstate, too."</p><p>"It's just unreal."</p><p>But for budget property buyers, what is unreal is the chea</p><p>p-as-chips price.</p><p>For just $75,000 you don't just get a two-year-old partly furnished home, but one that's parked just a short stroll to the beach.</p><p>The relocatable pad attracts no council rates, water bills or stamp duty, and is situated in the gated Nobby Beach Holiday Village, at 2200 Gold Coast Hwy, Miami.</p><p>The buyer will, however, have to fork out a $200 weekly site fee (rebated to $140 for pensioners) which also covers the use of the facilities, including a pool and barbecue area.</p><p>Mr Geles said the abode could be used as a permanent rental, holiday destination or principal place of residence.</p><p>"It's an ideal downgrade for pensioners where they can sell their home and then utilise their money for travel or lifestyle.''</p><p>The house is owned by Sydney high school teacher Vaska Blum who spent many school holidays in the tourist park and vowed to live there permanently upon retirement.</p><p>"You feel like you are on holidays all the time and the people here are always happy and talk about their adventures,'' Miss Blum said.</p><p>``It's close to everything and there is a real community feel. I was very, very happy here and felt very safe.</p><p>The house itself can be used as a permanent rental, holiday destination or principal place of residence and has a modern interior, gas cooking and hot water and airconditioning.</p><p>The weekly repayments on a $75,000 personal loan at 8 per cent interest taken over seven years would be $269.25.
