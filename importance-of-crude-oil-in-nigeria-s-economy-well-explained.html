Nigeria extracts several types of oil of the highest quality, including Forcados, Esquavos, Odudu, and Bonnie. Check out the benefits of crude oil in Nigeria's economy below.</p><h3>Importance of crude oil in Nigeria's economy</h3><p class=align-left>Nigeria has a total of 159 oil fields and 1481 wells in operation. The coastal Niger Delta Basin has 78 oil fields. Small unproductive fields accounted for 62.1% of Nigeria's oil production capacity, while the sixteen largest fields produced 37.9% of Nigeria’s petroleum. Below is a list of 10 importance of crude oil in Nigeria:</p><h4>1. Oil production is the country's main source of revenue</h4><p class=align-left>Nigeria's oil revenue has totaled $340 billion in exports since the 1970s. Nigeria's major clients for decades are the UK, Germany, and China.</p><p class=align-left>OPEC's Oil Market Report for July 2022, obtained by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">showed an increase </a>of 5,000 barrels per day compared to the average 1.233 million BPD produced in May 2022.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9e409e07be74f6e8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigeria may approach the IMF for bailout amid growing debt</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Despite the improvement in fossil fuel prices, the oil sector contributed 5.19 percent to total real GDP (N1.055trn) in Q4 2021 and 7.24% for the entire year 2021. The figure is less than the preceding year because high inflation has reduced private sector optimism and weakened consumer spending.</p><p class=align-left>Nigerians hope the current economic situation will be short-term. Oil <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revenue is projected</a> at N3.16 trillion, FGN Independent revenues are projected to be N1.82 trillion, and Non-oil <a href=#>taxes</a> are estimated at N2.13 trillion by the end of 2022.</p><h4>2. Oil is the main source of power for industries</h4><p class=align-left>Nigeria's cars, trains, and industrial machinery use petrol and diesel. In addition, most small businesses use petrol/diesel generators for lighting and operating machines.</p><h4>3. Oil is a major source of energy for households</h4><p class=align-left>Most families in Nigeria use petrol or diesel-powered generators to light their homes and run appliances like cookers, washing machines, televisions, etc. Many households also use domestic natural gas for cooking and lighting. Families that use electricity still have generators as alternative energy sources during electricity blackouts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/26e543ee007dd4c3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How energy costs are driving up price of cement as Dangote, BUA spend N174.5 billion on fuel and power</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e383778754eddb60.jpg><h4>4.

The oil industry attracts foreign investors</h4><p class=align-left>Foreign investors who want to cut the cost of importing oil as a raw material for their products establish manufacturing companies in Nigeria. Additionally, some oil mining and production companies in Nigeria are foreign firms.</p><h4>6. It creates jobs for many Nigerians</h4><p class=align-left>Another importance of crude oil 194 is that it creates jobs for many Nigerians.<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> 0.03% of Nigeria's </a>69.54 million labor force worked in the oil industry as of 2018.

The oil industry improves people's standards of living</h4><p class=align-left>Another economic importance of petroleum in Nigeria is that the sector improves people's living standards. For example, the government used oil production revenue to build and improve social amenities like schools, hospitals, police stations, recreation centers, and more.</p><p class=align-left>In addition, people who work in the oil industry also <a href=#>make enough money</a> to afford quality education, health services, recreation services, and more.</p><h4>9. Oil production promotes security in the country</h4><p class=align-left>Households and businesses use generators for lighting at night. Others use generators to power their CCTV cameras, electric fences, and other security systems during electricity blackouts. Excellent security is one of the main boosters of economic growth.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ef34585366c13342.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Benedict Peters: The silent billionaire with the largest oil tank farms in Nigeria</span></p></a><h4>10. Oil production lowers energy costs and promotes energy security</h4><p class=align-left>A massive oil and gas supply lowers energy costs for the people. People and businesses can avoid high electricity costs by using oil and gas as main or alternative <a href=#>energy sources</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Additionally, a country that produces oil and gas in large quantities achieves energy security because it invests less in electricity, solar, and other energy sources.</p><h3>NIPC road-map on how to maximize the importance of crude oil in Nigeria</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9e409e07be74f6e8.jpg><p class=align-left>The Nigerian Investment and Promotion Commission has plans (road-map) for improving oil production and increasing its economic benefits to the country.

They want to reduce the importation of petroleum products by 60 percent</strong></h4><p class=align-left>Nigeria will become a net exporter of petroleum products and value-added petrochemicals if it reduces the importation of petroleum products by 60 percent. Therefore, an aggressive revamping of local refining capacity through greenfield, co-location, and modular refineries is necessary.</p><h4><strong>4.
