LOL," Fif captioned a post.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It didn't take long for Buck to fire right back. Fif has continued to face allegations of cooperating with federal authorities which have haunted him over the years-- <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">as recent as January, French Montana exposed 50 Cent's&nbsp;alleged informant paperwork</a>. Though he's denied that is the case, we all know what&nbsp;type of stain that leaves on the reputation of any rapper. Even with the allegations, Fif's denied it and considering those who've brought up these allegations are foes of the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>G-Unit</a> leader, it hasn't necessarily been taken seriously. "Somebody tell this bitch ass nigga 50cent Finish Dat Bowl of #FruitSteroids,” he wrote. “and wrap ya Monthly Police Report Up …. C.I #ConfidentialInformant Face Ass,"&nbsp;Buck wrote before reminding Fif that they do have history together.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"CURTIS…it’s me BUCK….don’t ever forget I Know U….and I Ain’t Got Started Yet," he added.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">So far, no word from 50 Cent but we'll keep you posted. Will they keep the beef to IG or do you think there's any chance they'll be firing shots on wax?
