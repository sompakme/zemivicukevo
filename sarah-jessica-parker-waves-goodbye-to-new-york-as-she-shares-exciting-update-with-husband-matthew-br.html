The couple share three children, son James, 20, and twin daughters Marion and Tabitha, 14.&nbsp;</p><p id=eEqkdpg3fb data-wc=43>The close-knit family live in a beautiful townhouse in New York's West Village, and Sarah has been named the 'Queen of the West Village' by locals. While the star and her family are relatively private, she occasionally opens up about her personal life.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f307941acf89-sjp-gothic-ballet-dress.jpg><p id=e6Yccj9wn- data-wc=60>This year, the 58-year-old sat down to talk about the dynamics at her home with Bruce Bozzi for iHeart podcast Table for Two. While chatting about family meals. she revealed that they were all home bodies, preferring to cook every night and foregoing the desire to go out or order in. "We cook every night," the Hocus Pocus star said.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d31f150513cf-sarah-jessica-parker-fall-ballet-full-length.jpg><p id=e_2frehOQ0 data-wc=79>"It's a source of huge amount of pride for everybody. But it's also mystifying because we just don't order in as a family. "And on the rare occasion we have… we always hear [of] other families, they do it and then one kid orders from this place and one kid [from another], it's so confusing…But we really do cook 5 to 6 nights a week for sure. We try to always have a Sunday dinner – we invite people."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0e8d636c20cd-sjp-nyc.jpg><p id=e2ptJT2uU5 data-wc=73>Elsewhere in their conversation, the actress and mom-of-three described raising her children to work hard for the things they want while still having access to what they need. "I think it's a great way of living for children that their needs are met – to be fed, safe and loved, the important things in life: books and food and interesting experiences, and they're warm in the winter and cool in summer," Sarah said.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3OUCwv3jY data-wc=24>"But they should pine for things, they should want things.
