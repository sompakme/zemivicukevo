Brown made jokes about being a stepmother to Newton's seven kids. Apparently, the jokes went over the head of a few people who listened to Brown's comedy gig. Fans of Brown seemed to take issue with the jokes, seemingly believed she was having a real conversation about her life. Newton had seen enough of the hateful comments and decided to defend Brown's comedy set.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the video posted on Brown's Instagram page, comments began flooding the post about Brown's personal life choices. That is when Newton <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">commented in the only we he can</a>. “Wēłp thátš whÿ ī áīñt wīt ÿøū‼️🤷🏾‍♂️łøł ītš Ł£V£Łš tø thīš QÜ££Ñ… ÄÑD ÎF §ØM£ØÑ£ Î§ ₩ØRTH ÎT; ÿø ášš wøūłd dø áłøt øf thīñgš ÿøū ØÑČ£ šáīd ÿøū wøūłdñt dø⚠️, ī høpē ÿøū fīñd šømēøñē thøūgh… Î ₩ØÜŁD HÄT£ FØR ÄÑ¥ØÑ£ TØ GØ THRØÜGH ŁÎF£ ÄŁØÑ£🐸☕️‼️ ī wøūłd hátē īt thērē…😫łøł-1ØV£🤟🏾.” Newton has been known for his strange text when posting on social media. However, the message is clear as day.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-cam-newton-stands-up-for-jasmin-brown>Cam Newton Stands Up For Jasmin Brown</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Newton has recently been in the news regarding his future playing career in the NFL. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The former league MVP</a> admitted that he would be open to a backup role with certain teams. However, Newton also claimed that he is better than a few quarterbacks who already have starting roles in the league. Whatever the case may be, it does seem Newton is itching to return to a football field. The former Panthers star could be a great mentor for a young quarterback looking to carve his own path.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The situation with Brown has quickly been squashed by Netwon. Newton is frequently sharing photos of his family on Instagram. It seems as if the former quarterback is a happy family man and will protect his own. Brown's words were part of a comedy routine.
