urgency'</h2><p class=align-left>Bathhouse closures can erode community ties, said Sam Holden, whose organisation Sento & Neighborhood used a grant of around $200,000 from the <a href=#>World</a> Monuments Fund to renovate Inariyu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

1930 in a low-rise area of northern Tokyo where narrow walkways snake between homes.</p><p class=align-left>Inariyu has customers of all ages, including "a lot of elderly people, many of whom might live alone and be prone to isolation", said Holden, a 32-year-old American who has lived in the capital for nearly a decade.</p><p class=align-left>"My colleagues and I had a sense of urgency in
