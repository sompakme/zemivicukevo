I cannot do this,'” Clarkson shared. “And it was one of those things where I really had to put my pride aside and like all my childhood issues of whatever.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>getty images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, “I was on Lexapro for like, I think two months. My thing was, I just can't smile anymore for America right now. I'm not happy and I need help … and it was, honest to God, the greatest decision, ever. I wouldn't have made it [without it].”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Kelly has long been vocal about how her divorce from Blackstock (with whom she shares two children) heavily influenced Chemistry, she recently revealed that she was sure to give her ex-husband a heads-up before the album debuted on June 23.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I don't even remember why or how it happened, but I [texted him] like, 'Hey, I didn't just diminish us down to one [thing],' " she shared during a Friday appearance on Today. "You know what I'm saying? It’s all in there, the ride. The beauty is in there, as well. Now there's a lot of pain, but that’s what happens for all of us.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, “It's very personal. And I've always released personal music — I think I'm that kind of writer in general, everybody knows that. I think when you have kids — you both have kids, too — you kind of debate, 'What am I going to do here?' So I was very selective about the songs I picked for the album.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqdllJ7DsL7CnmSapqSesaa80Z6qrJmeqcBug5Rua29oZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
