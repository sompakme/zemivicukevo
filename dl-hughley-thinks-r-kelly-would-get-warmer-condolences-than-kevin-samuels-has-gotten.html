"You can't shit on folks then want them to miss you when you're gone," one user responded to Hughley's tweet. "Cosby learned that hard lesson."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Someone in agreeance with the California native wrote, "A lot of people (women to be more particular) were triggered by [Samuels'] truth and his strong stance on his topics, that's why they didn't like him as much."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Truth? What truth? He found a way to blame women for pretty much everything," someone else argued. "Dismissed women over 35 as being unwanted. Come on. What did he say that was the truth?"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere in the news, last month DL Hughley made headlines with his commentary on "The Slap" at the Academy Awards and how it will have a long-lasting impact on Chris Rock's career – <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">read more about that here</a>, and tap back in with HNHH later for more pop culture news updates.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">RIP Kevin Samuels.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
