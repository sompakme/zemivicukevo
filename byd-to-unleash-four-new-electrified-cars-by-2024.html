It is the nation’s cheapest EV priced at $38,890 before on-road costs.</p><p>“The quality of the BYD product is unparalleled for the price point that you’re paying and we are confident in our product,” says Todd.</p><p>“If you put the Dolphin head-to-head in the market in a comparable spec the Dolphin is a standout in as far as its quality, driveability, space, affordability and you’re getting the best technology now.”</p><p>The Dolphin has been engineered to achieve a five-star ANCAP rating.</p><p>Following the Dolphin will be the Seal, which is a similar size to the fast-selling Tesla Model 3.</p><p>It’s a slick looking four door with a more up-market feel than the BYD Atto 3 and the Dolphin.</p><p>Todd says the exact Seal line-up wasn’t confirmed yet but there would be several options.</p><p>“That’s the one thing we are still working through, but obviously we’ll have the top-spec high-performance all-wheel drive model.”</p><p>Todd says there will also be a “very competitively priced” entry model that will be rear-wheel drive.</p><p>Todd expects both the Dolphin and Seal to be high-volume sellers and says the Seal has already had more than 10,000 inquiries.</p><p>BYD showed off an SUV version of the Seal, dubbed the Seal U, at the Munich motor show earlier this month.</p><p>That model isn’t earmarked for Australia as it isn’t being built in right-hand drive yet but Todd says Australia will be getting a similar sized SUV to the Seal U next year.</p><p>The mid-size SUV is likely to be revealed in a few months.</p><p>Utes are also on the brand’s hit list.</p><p>BYD will be bringing a plug-in hybrid ute to Australia next year followed by a full electric version.</p><p>“These are not hybrids like people in Australia know them. It’s not a petrol car converted and had a battery stuck in it. These are electric platform vehicles that have ultra low emission and small combustion 1.5-litre turbo motors put into them to give people the best of both worlds, so no range anxiety.”</p><p>Todd says the ute will be delivered in customers hands by the end of next year and the company is targeting 2025 for the full electric version.</p><p>He says some of Australia’s top engineers have been working with BYD and doing testing in the jungle and on proving grounds.</p><p>“It is possibly the most exciting vehicle to come to Australia. It is everything you’d want in a ute and pick-up,” says Todd.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7056aoaafobyoxY6mpq2nop67qHvMqKuoqpmjtG66xLCqaJqpmXq1u4yupaWdkai1brLOrqlmppWseqa4xJyrq6GWnrKlecKaqaxlkq56c3yRbWannaeoerTAzquwaG1jan55fsFtmZuelGexcq7BnWxwbmRprqSAmJ1wcZ5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
