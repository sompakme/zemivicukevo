However, while Anyone But You may not win points for originality, it has already garnered attention for the sex appeal and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/glen-powell-dating-life-relationship-rumors/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="believable chemistry" class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">believable chemistry</a> of its two leads: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/glen-powell-anyone-but-you-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Men's Health cover guy Glen Powell" class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">Men's Health cover guy Glen Powell</a>, who plays Ben, and Sydney Sweeney (Euphoria, The White Lotus), who plays Bea.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">This is never more evident than in the movie's hottest scene, where Ben and Bea get incredibly intimate while sharing a shower. But as both actors explain, filming the scene was a lot more awkward than it comes across in the final cut.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">"When we were doing that, there were other people weighing in on what we should do in that scene," Powell told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.eonline.com/news/1391310/sydney-sweeney-and-glen-powell-reveal-what-it-was-really-like-filming-steamy-shower-scene data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=E! class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">E!</a>. "I was like, 'I don't like when crew members are weighing in on how I should do a sexy shower scene.' You start getting in the head of some of your crew members. You're like, 'That is weird, man. Can't look at you the same way.'"</p><img alt="glen powell, sydney sweeney, anyone but you" title="glen powell, sydney sweeney, anyone but you" width=1500 height=833 decoding=async data-nimg=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screenshot-2023-10-19-at-14-39-55-65313491a7c56.png><span class="css-1avdefm e6iqukd1">Sony Pictures</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Sweeney agrees that shooting the scantily-clad moment on a crowded set was an unusual experience, but that her rapport with Powell made it easier.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">"There's always an awkward moment, but I don't know if it's because you're so close to someone other than the 40 crew members that are watching you film thisâ€”that's the awkward part," she said. "If anything, I feel more safe with someone who I'm friends with than some people that you don't really know."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Powell added that the key to making Anyone But You was feeling like he and his co-star were on the same team. "I feel like the one thing is, when you're making a movie, is to know that you have a teammate," he said. "When you make a rom-com, you have to do a lot of crazy things. If you get through a rom-com and look cool, you're doing it all wrong. So to have a teammate where I feel like we could be our goofiest, dumbest, most stripped-down selves, I think that is the key to a great teammate."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrHNrJ%2BemZyptW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSudYKRbmxycGhkrq%2FFzqecZpqlqXq6u9RmqqGnp5q%2Fbr%2FEsWSsm5Wjsm6x16mjmqGemrFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
