The couple appeared to have one of the strongest marriages in the business. They <a href=#>married for 36 years</a>, shared two children, and regularly collaborated. Pegi was waiting tables when she first met Neil, but she was a talented singer and songwriter. She appeared on a number of his tracks, and they often <a href=#>performed live.</a>&nbsp;She also had a <a href=#>music career</a> of her own.</p><p>Pegi sang "Philadelphia" with Neil at the <a href=#>1994 Oscars</a>, and they toured together. She joined him on stage during his 1983 Fifties retro tour and was a backup singer on his Summer 200 Friends and Relatives tour. The two launched the Bridge School in 1986. Zeke Young, <a href=#>Neil's son</a> from his previous relationship with Carrie Snodgress, has Cerebral Palsey. So does Neil and Pegi's son, Ben Young, while their <a href=#>daughter has epilepsy</a>. Per <a href=#>the school website</a>, it offers "creative approaches to education and communication" for children with severe physical and speech impairments. Following the school's launch, Neil and Pegi began <a href=#>a local annual fundraising concert</a>, with all proceeds going to the facility.</p><p>Pegi knew couples needed their space. "We like to do things together, we hang out, we have fun together [but] a little space is always good," she told <a href=#>Songfacts</a> in 2010. "You can't live in each other's back pocket all the time." Finally, Neil filed for divorce in 2014. Why did this legendary pair finally call it quits?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmlobYZye9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2jsqq4jJqlnWWgmrSqediorKefo2KxqsLOq5qeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
