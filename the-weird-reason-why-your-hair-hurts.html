Then, out of nowhere, it starts to physically throb. Science says hair can’t actually hurt (hair is dead, after all), but that uncomfortable tender-headed feeling isn't your imagination. A sore, achy scalp can leave your hair feeling sensitive to the touch, causing you to avoid&nbsp;combing, brushing, or even washing your hair.</p><p>“Scalp sensitivities can occur due to many things, from seasonal changes when the weather gets dryer to product irritations or buildup (i.e. sometimes overusing <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/g4434/best-dry-shampoo-for-every-hair-type/>dry shampoo</a> can clog your scalp making it itchy and uncomfortable), to even wearing hats too often,” explains House of Frieda celebrity stylist, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/laurapolko/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Laura Polko</u></a>, whose clients include Charli D’Amelio and Madelyn Cline.&nbsp;Once irritation takes hold, inflammation can start to make your hair feel like it's hurting. "If you then find yourself scratching your scalp, you’ll actually end up releasing cytokines, these little chemicals that start a whole inflammatory cascade through your scalp," adds Yale dermatologist Mona Gohara, MD. "With more inflammation, brings more blood flow to the area, resulting in that throbbing pain you feel in your hair.’”</p><p>All that said, if you maintain healthy scalp hygiene and still experience scalp issues, something larger might be at play. Below, we break down the five main culprits of a tender scalp—and dermatologist-approved recommendations to reduce the pain.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-tension-on-the-hair-and-scalp><span>Tension on the Hair and Scalp</span></h2><p>Certain tight or heavy hairstyles, such as braids, weaves, or extensions, cause constant tension on the hair and scalp. Unfortunately, this excess pulling can lead to a condition called <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470434/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>traction alopecia</a>, where the hair follicles are under continuous stress, and eventually stop growing.&nbsp;“Over time, this can cause inflammation of the hair follicles and surrounding scalp tissues,” explains celebrity hairstylist, licensed trichologist and Senior Director of Product Development at MAV Beauty Brands, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__urldefense.com_v3_-5F-5Fhttps-3A_www.linkedin.com_in_kimberlee-2Dblakley-2D93730112b-5F-5F-3B-21-21Ivohdkk-21ifWrWTtmpHaijEbXUyrR7vv6ZNfIrHvK6bwSoldR-5FP66YHexdnAlFHDDkbscZJ5ENaFXTPB8bCXMuBKg-24&d=DwMGaQ&c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&r=xXVng0YdxvrZt5WjG0WGjg&m=HsjCpQJVVC1yA4-gp_XZ7fLgAUE57K6u-HceNQBPbnye5U06yLnAw_k_UsYkpWDv&s=Y6ncPuL3xVzAJP63QeLiF9085TrVxGj8-SziZjOAMcE&e=" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Kimberlee J. Blakley</u></a>. “The pain associated with tension alopecia results from the continuous strain on the hair roots.”</p><p>To combat scalp pain from tension, she suggests by shying away from frequent tight ponytails and top knots. “If you have a protective style, your concern is preserving your scalp and your investment,” she shares. “But, if you notice any tiny bumps or pustules at the scalp, remove them ASAP.”&nbsp;Her best advice? Don’t be afraid to speak up to your stylist if you feel pain or tugging at your scalp during or after your appointment.&nbsp;You can also include a scalp oil in your regimen to keep the scalp hydrated.</p><a href=# data-model-name="H2Oh!

While there are a few different diagnoses that could be at play, a fairly common one is called folliculitis. Folliculitis is the inflammation or infection of hair follicles, which sometimes results in major discomfort. “When hair follicles become clogged, they can get red, swollen, and painful,” explains Blakely. “Folliculitis can result from bacterial, fungal, or viral infections, and it often occurs when the hair follicles become clogged, either from oil, sweat, or other debris. The pain may result from inflammation, itching, or even a reaction to accumulating residues on the scalp.”</p><p>If you suspect folliculitis is the culprit of your hair's pain, getting a professionals opinion is best. Even mild infections might require a prescription lotion, gel, or pill. You'll want to visit a board-certified dermatologist or trichologist who is "trained to diagnose and address issues related to the hair and scalp."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-infrequent-washing><span>Infrequent Washing</span></h2><p>If you’ve pushed past your suggested wash day, your hair can start to feel a little, well, off. There’s a reason for that. “A clogged scalp prevents both sebum and hair from growing and releasing naturally from the hair follicle,” explains NYC-based hair health expert and trichologist, Shab Caspara. “It creates inflammation and hinders hair growth, disrupts the scalp microbiome, and causes the overproduction of sebum." Think of the resulting irritation as your body's defense mechanism.</p><p>The good news: The fix is pretty easy. Adding a clarifying shampoo into your routine biweekly is a great tool to get rid of buildup, especially if you’ve used a lot of product in your hair, like a dry shampoo. “Clarifying shampoos typically contain more harsh cleansing agents and are therefore recommended to use on an as-needed basis,” she explains. “To prevent drying-out your strands, focus mostly on the scalp and avoid scrubbing the product into your actual hair.”</p><a href=# data-model-name="Clarifying Shampoo" data-url="https://4ubytia.com/products/clarifying-shampoo?variant=43684558569712" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/33hkHRSb5RX4ABbx8dayJC-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Clarifying Shampoo</p><p>This purifying shampoo relies on a mix of clean ingredients like apple cider vinegar and sea moss extract to clean hair without stripping.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Works on colored or chemically treated hair&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Designed for curly and/or textured hair</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>“I wish I had known about this brand sooner!

Curls and coils can often prolong time in between shampoos, whereas straight, finer hair types may find their hair getting greasy after a few days. Consider other variables like workout schedule, product usage, and hair porosity to find the right sweet spot.&nbsp;</p><p>If you do need to wash your hair every day or every other day, make sure you're using a hydrating shampoo that will restore moisture to the scalp.</p><a href=# data-model-name="Biotera Ultra Moisturizing Shampoo | Hydrates Dry, Damaged, Coarse Hair | Microbiome Friendly | Vegan & Cruelty Free | Paraben & Sulfate Free | Color-Safe | 15.2 Fl Oz" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/Biotera-Moisturizing-Shampoo-Microbiome-Friendly/dp/B0B5FRVD47/ref=asc_df_B0B5FRVD47/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=632174210858&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=16664815333899404842&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9060351&hvtargid=pla-1934702934932&psc=1&mcid=c6d03576d9973755b806f54dcda21c6b&gclid=Cj0KCQiAgqGrBhDtARIsAM5s0_nxJqxg1RaRlMoRVYcmzsvugWh_SQv96cEezMA3HrMQIqEE2vwWyj8aAgW4EALw_wcB" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FBiotera-Moisturizing-Shampoo-Microbiome-Friendly%2Fdp%2FB0B5FRVD47%2Fref%3Dasc_df_B0B5FRVD47%2F%3FlinkCode%3Ddf0%26hvadid%3D632174210858%26hvpos%3D%26hvnetw%3Dg%26hvrand%3D16664815333899404842%26hvpone%3D%26hvptwo%3D%26hvqmt%3D%26hvdev%3Dc%26hvdvcmdl%3D%26hvlocint%3D%26hvlocphy%3D9060351%26hvtargid%3Dpla-1934702934932%26psc%3D1%26mcid%3Dc6d03576d9973755b806f54dcda21c6b%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAgqGrBhDtARIsAM5s0_nxJqxg1RaRlMoRVYcmzsvugWh_SQv96cEezMA3HrMQIqEE2vwWyj8aAgW4EALw_wcB%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmT7sYuPAMF4vLaNJThXV3-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>Biotera Ultra Moisturizing Shampoo | Hydrates Dry, Damaged, Coarse Hair | Microbiome Friendly | Vegan & Cruelty Free | Paraben & Sulfate Free | Color-Safe | 15.2 Fl Oz</p><p>Created to be gentle on the scalp’s biome, this professional line of shampoos are uniquely formulated with ingredients like coconut yogurt and ginseng for optimal hair health.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Gently cleansing formula, free from SLS/SLES Sulfates*</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Fragrant smell&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Review: </strong>“This shampoo is awesome!!
