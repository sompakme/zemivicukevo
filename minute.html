We know from the distance formula (d) using rate (r) and time (t) that: d = rt Regular speed: 1200 = rt Divide each side by t, we get: r = 1200/t Reduced speed. 20 minutes = 60/20 = 1/3 of an hour. So we multiply 1,200 by 3 3600 = (r - 40)(t + 1/3) If we multiply 3 by (t + 1/3), we get: 3t + 1 So we have: 3600 = (r - 40)(3t + 1) Substitute r = 1200/t into the reduced speed equation: 3600 = (1200/t - 40)(3t + 1) Multiply through and we get: 3600 = 3600 - 120t + 1200/t - 40 Subtract 3,600 from each side 3600 - 3600 = 3600 - 3600 - 120t + 1200/t - 40 The 3600's cancel, so we get: - 120t + 1200/t - 40 = 0 Multiply each side by t: -120t^2 - 40t + 1200 = 0 We've got a quadratic equation.

Remember he's putting a new 4 inch layer down over all the area currently covered by grass in the overhead picture above. [*]How big is the yard? I'm not sure, but you can probably estimate it using the overhead picture. [*]What kind of pickup truck does he drive? A 2003 Ford F-150 XL. [*]How much can the pickup carry? The truck bed is 80 inches long, 69 inches wide, and 20 inches tall. [*]How much is the delivery charge? $30 per truckload on top of the soil cost. Each truckload can deliver up to 18 cubic yards. [*]How much does the topsoil cost? $18 per cubic yard (sold in 1/4 yard increments). [*]How far is the soil store? It is 9 miles away. It takes about 20 minutes to drive there.
