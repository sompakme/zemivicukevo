The famed Kardashian sister is no stranger to being followed around by cameras after spending over a decade on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, but it was clear that the show wasn't her favorite thing to do. For years, Kourtney has been the subject of memes connected to&nbsp;random comments that she made on the series, and in a recent interview with Bustle, she detailed just how much she hated the E! hit.</p><p>Frazer Harrison / Staff / Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I would <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">fight with my sisters</a>.

On their previous show, Kourtney stated that she would have to give herself a "pep talk" before shooting, but this time around, she's "happier than [she's] ever been."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fans are expecting Travis and Kourtney's courtship to be a focal point of the new series, including their forthcoming nuptials.
