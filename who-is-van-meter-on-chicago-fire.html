This presented a big mystery that will likely be addressed later.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-van-meter-on-chicago-fire>Who is Van Meter on Chicago Fire?</h2><p>One question that some Chicago Fire fans were left with at the end of that episode was the meaning of the reference to Van Meter. Die-hard fans likely knew immediately who Stella was talking about, but it’s also a detail that some One Chicago fans may not have understood.</p><p>Captain Tom Van Meter&nbsp;is an arson investigator for the Office of Fire Investigation (OFI). Played by actor Tim Hopper, the character has asked Severide for a lot of help over the years. At one point, Severide was even assigned to OFI to work for Van Meter on a backlog of cases.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Severide-And-Van-Meter-Chicago-Fire.jpg><p>Severide has also learned a lot from Van Meter, but at this stage of their careers, Severide might be the best arson investigator at the CFD. There’s a good reason that his nickname has become “Fire Cop” on the show.</p><p>In a recent episode, one of the bosses for the Chicago Fire Department forced Severide to look into Van Meter due to some questions that came up in a fire investigation. It strained the relationship between Van Meter and Severide, possibly to a breaking point that could become even more important.</p><p>Now, there are heavy hints that <a href=#>a reason Severide will not be on Chicago Fire</a> for a while is due to a situation that involves Van Meter. Outside of the show, though, most fans already know that actor Taylor Kinney took a leave of absence for personal reasons.</p><p>Answers about what is going on should come during the March 1 episode, where <a href=#>Chicago Fire threatened to kill off Blake Gallo</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More news from One Chicago</h2><p>Elsewhere in the world of One Chicago, a new episode of <a href=#>Chicago P.D. brings back Samantha Beck</a>.
