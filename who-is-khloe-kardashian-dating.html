Having said that, on February 6 2023 Khloe opened up about her dating life to a curious fan via Twitter. When asked if she was in a relationship with anyone at that time, she replied: "No man right now… He's in my prayers," suggesting the 38-year-old is interested in dating again if the opportunity arises.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson: why did they split?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8c1f8fb41153-gettyimages-1395076948.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson: why did they split?" class="miniCardLink_m75k0hi hm-link" href=# rel>Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson: why did they split?</a></h5></li></ul><p id=e6YyT4Qot2x data-wc=56>However, she did also suggest she has no time for someone right now as she is focusing on bringing up <a class=hm-link href=#>her two young children</a>.

However, it is also possible that the reality TV star will decide to set up more boundaries between what she shares and what she keeps to herself, meaning whether or not the model is dating someone will remain hard to tell.</p><h2><strong>Who is Khloe Kardashian's husband?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/9fabfea2eb76-who-is-khloe-kardashian-dating-4.jpg><p id=eYRjl13jLf20 data-wc=77>Khloe is currently unmarried, however the star has been married once before. In 2009, the then 25-year-old tied the knot with NBA player Lamar Odom after a whirlwind romance which lasted only a month. The couple were together for four years, but Khloe <a class=hm-link href=#>filed for a divorce</a> in 2013. In his 2019 memoir , Lamar revealed he had cheated on Khloe throughout their marriage. "I had a problem," he admitted while detailing <a class=hm-link href=#>his regular infidelities</a>.</p><p id=eCCO-lIccfvO data-wc=40>Following on from Khloe's relationship with Lamar, the star dated another NBA player, Tristan Thompson, between the years 2016 and 2021. The couple's relationship was again a turbulent one which often broke&nbsp;up due to reports that Tristan was unfaithful.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/b59e2d2328fb-who-is-khloe-kardashian-dating-2.jpg><p id=eHmc1_ebySP2 data-wc=67>One of those times included an incident in February 2019 when the Lakers player was <a class=hm-link href=#>caught kissing Jordyn Woods</a>, a friend of Khloe's half-sister <a class=hm-link href=#>Kylie Jenner</a>. However, the couple rekindled their bond in 2020. Khloe and Tristan split for the final time for the final time in late 2021, after it was revealed the basketball player had cheated and had a child with Instagram-famous model Maralee Nichols.</p><p id=eDAuzxq0J9W data-wc=6><strong>DISCOVER:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Is Kim Kardashian a lawyer?</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2><strong>Does Khloe Kardashian have a baby now?</strong></h2><p id=e-IMzM-WprS0 data-wc=56>Yes, despite Khloe and Tristan's rather up-and-down relationship, the couple share two children together: <a class=hm-link href=#>True, five</a>, and a <a class=hm-link href=#>soon-to-be one year old son</a>, whose name has not yet been made public by the couple. While Khloe gave birth to True on April 12 2018, the pair's second child was <a class=hm-link href=#>born via a surrogate</a> in July 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d727c25ab9d9-who-is-khloe-kardashian-dating-5.jpg><p id=elBo5T-3J2G5 data-wc=59>In December 2017, Khloe took to Instagram to personally announce that she was expecting her first child with Tristan. "My greatest dream realised! We are having a baby! I had been waiting and wondering but God had a plan all along. He knew what He was doing. I simply had to trust in Him and be patient," she wrote.</p><p id=es43GeWpbPS_ data-wc=73>True's birth in 2018 <a class=hm-link href=#>was overshadowed</a> by the first speculation that Tristan was cheating on Khloe. However, as previously mentioned, the couple remained in an on-again-off-again relationship until late 2021. The couple welcomed their second child via surrogate <a class=hm-link href=#>following their split</a>, and currently are not officially back together (although there has been <a class=hm-link href=#>some fan speculation</a>). Instead, Tristan and Khloe are focusing on co-parenting their kids, and remain <a class=hm-link href=#>a close-knit family</a> despite their troubles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/272400ebc942-who-is-khloe-kardashian-dating-6.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/6360562a141b-who-is-khloe-kardashian-dating-8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/bcc9d9cc9279-who-is-khloe-kardashian-dating-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5a5d3d0568e5-who-is-khloe-kardashian-dating-7.jpg><p id=eSp9ixWq4LX data-wc=6><strong>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
