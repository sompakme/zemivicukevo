I mean, I think that representation really does matter,” she adds.</p><h2>Tiffany’s backstory</h2><p>Tiffany shared her backstory with RHOD costar Brandi Redmond <a href=#>while confronting Brandi on a racist video</a> she had uploaded impersonating Asians.</p><p>“When I was three years old, my parents immigrated to America without me,” she told Brandi. “They left me behind to have the opportunity for a better life. So from the time I was three to the time I was six, I did not see my parents. They left me with my grandparents.”</p><p>“When I was six they put me on a plane from Beijing to New York by myself and I landed in America to meet my parents,” Tiffany revealed emotionally. “I haven’t seen them in three years. I knew not a lick of English. Not a lick.”</p><p>Even though she had a hard start, Tiffany ended up graduating college when she was 19 and graduated med school at the young age of 23.</p><h2>Tiffany’s life now</h2><p>The 36-year-old is a successful anesthesiologist. As a medical professional, she has been stressing the importance of <a href=#>safety during the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p><p>She explained on the RHOD premiere her workplace stopped doing elective surgery at the height of the pandemic. This allowed her to spend more time with her family.</p><p>Her husband, Daniel Moon, owns a jewelry store called Sam Moon.</p><p>The two share four children together. They had 6-year-old twins Chloe and Madison together and Daniel brought in his 16-year-old twins Nathan and Nicole.</p><p>Tiffany was introduced to RHOD by her friend D’Andra Simmons whom she refers to as a sister.</p><p>It’s no surprise that she and D’Andra get along, but viewers have already seen in the trailer that Tiffany <a href=#>will clash with sophomore cast member Kary Brittingham</a>.</p><p>The Real Housewives of Dallas airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ6Ses6etzbJkpqefo3q1rcukqmaalZ67qHnToZxmnpmnwLV5wKygmqZdlrqmvsicmKdlmKTCtLHWop2eZZ%2BjerO0zp1m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
