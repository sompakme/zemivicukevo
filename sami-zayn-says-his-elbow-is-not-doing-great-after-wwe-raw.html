That being said, Zayn stated that his elbow is not doing great after RAW this week.</p><p>Last week, Sami Zayn was taken out of a massive 6-man tag team match via storyline in order to cover up for a real injury, <a href=#>which turned out to be bursa sac injury. Naturally, this had fans worried for his well-being</a>.</p><p>Sami Zayn squared off against JD McDonagh on this week’s episode of Monday Night RAW. However, he would also get re-injured his elbow following a brutal assault at the hands of McDonagh after the main event of the show.</p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Out of Character&nbsp;podcast with Ryan Satin, Sami Zayn talked about the current condition of his elbow. Zayn admitted that his elbow is not doing great after RAW this week.</p><p>But I’ve been battling a lot of little nagging injuries for some time, but nothing to the extent that would put me on the shelf. So [my elbow] is part of a nagging injury that’s just kind of gotten a little bit worse after this past week’s heinous attacks by JD McDonagh, for which there will be revenge.</p><p>So maintaining your health and addressing those nagging injuries, I think that’ll become more important. But I still managed to give you a long-winded answer to a very easy question. My elbow’s alright, it’ll be okay. It’s not great, but it will be okay.”</p><p>With Kevin Owens still out of action due to a legitimate injury, it is not known what WWE will have planned for Owens and Sami Zayn as the Undisputed Tag Team Champions. We’ll have to see what will become of the two in the coming weeks.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your view on what Sami Zayn said?
