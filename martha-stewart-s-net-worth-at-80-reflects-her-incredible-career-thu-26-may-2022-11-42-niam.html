If you havenâ€™t seen her on TV, youâ€™ve probably read one of her books or something else sheâ€™s created during her extensive and impressive career. Stewart is now 80 years old and has racked up a pretty substantial CV â€“ and a healthy bank balance too!</strong></p><p>The entrepreneur and businesswoman has started multiple companies under her name and, when she launched Martha Stewart Omnimedia, she became the first American self-made female billionaire. Sadly, over time, the companyâ€™s market cap dropped â€“ but that doesnâ€™t mean she isnâ€™t still doing well for herself.</p><p>Reality Titbit has all the details on Marthaâ€™s net worth as well as how she made her money and her career as a multi-faceted entrepreneur.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure>BridTV10183Family Reboot | Official Trailer | Disney+https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w8v6hN8F4Kc/hqdefault.jpg10190811019081center22403<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2022/05/GettyImages-1240247540-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-martha-stewart-s-net-worth>Martha Stewartâ€™s net worth</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CelebrityNetWorth</a> reports Martha Stewart is worth a whopping $400 million. The TV personality has earned this fortune through multiple businesses that are part of the Martha Stewart Brand, which includes TV, magazines and home products.</p><p>Stewart was worth more than a billion dollars at one point but over time the market cap of her company, Martha Stewart Omnimedi, more than halved. Stewart became a billionaire when she and business partner Sharon Patrick secured funding in 1997 to purchase all the television, print and merchandising ventures associated with her brand.</p><p>Despite her losing money, I donâ€™t think she will be complaining about a $400 million bank balance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Martha Stewart (@marthastewart)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=martha-stewarts-impressive-career>Martha Stewartâ€™s impressive career</h2><p>What really kick-started Marthaâ€™s career was when she published her first book.
