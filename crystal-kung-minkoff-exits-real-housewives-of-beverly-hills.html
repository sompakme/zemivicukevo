Never did I think I would’ve been asked to do this show in a million years, let alone film it for three seasons. Every single year I was asked back, it was a blessing. It was an honor.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Minkoff was the first Asian American housewife on <a href=# id=auto-tag_bravo data-tag=bravo>Bravo</a>‘s L.A.-based Housewives series. In her video, she noted that “being the first Asian American on&nbsp;Beverly Hills&nbsp;was a lot of weight on my shoulders that I have since just have really understood the magnitude of what that meant for people.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">During her tenure on the show, Minkoff was also open about her struggle with an eating disorder and navigating health issues with her father.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I just wanted to thank you guys for being such an incredible support for me,” she said, “and I hope that I have been for you, sharing my story with my ED, sharing stories about my father and his Alzheimer’s. I’ve heard so many incredible stories from you guys.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She concluded by hinting there may be more to come. “This is not goodbye, this is see you soon,” she said. “I have some other things going on that I will be sharing with you soon that I’ll still be able to connect with you because at the end of the day, that is been my biggest gift of filming. This show is connecting with so many of you with your beautiful stories.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOnKmyq6SWuW631KeeZqWZo7iwssVmnLGhpKh6s7HApWShp6Wosri11Z6qZqeWYq%2BmwsSro7JlmJ65rb%2BMamlsbWhsgXl%2FlWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
