Come and live with us,” he said as the young man stood in disbelief.</p><p>Mr Taylor, who organised the touching gesture, later said the young man had lived a tough life, in and out of foster homes, and always struggled to get ahead despite his hard work.</p><p>“He is a beautiful person … Me and my wife had an idea and we put it to my bosses, we went dollar for dollar and gave him a Christmas gift and long-awaited helping hand,” he said.</p><p>“In doing so, we changed his life and took away a lot of stress.”</p><p>Trent McWaide, Managing Director of Roadsmart Fleet Steel River, an industrial tyre shop servicing The Central Coast and surrounds, was among the colleagues to chip in.</p><p>“Our aim was to give him a family – to let him know that we all care about him and he’s always got a family in us,” Mr McWaide told news.com.au.</p><p>He said the young worker had gone above and beyond in the workplace and asked for little in return.</p><p>“The car and other items that we gave him are just a physical acknowledgment of our love and support for him and to give him the confidence moving forward that people care about him,” he said.</p><p>“He’s worked so hard since he has been employed by us. It just goes to show that if you have a crack in life, things somehow have a way of figuring themselves out.</p><p>“What has impressed me most about this is how he has reacted to the gift … that just tells you the type of person he is.</p><p>“It’s wasn’t about the car or other items. It was about the opportunity he’s been given.”</p><p>Mr McWaide hopes others in the position to give this holiday period would consider doing the same.</p><p>“I hope this story can give someone hope this Christmas. If that’s the case, job done,” he said.</p><p>A version of the video shared on social media captured hundreds of thousands of hearts in just hours, quickly going viral.</p><p>Some said it was apparent how grateful the young was for his co-workers’ generous act.</p><p>“I love that instead of going to the car, he went straight in for the hugs! True appreciation,” one observed.</p><p>“Grateful young man who went straight in for the hug,” said another.</p><p>Others praised what was shown to be a caring workplace.</p><p>“Incredible … what an amazing company. Definitely a family,” one person exclaimed.</p><p>Another added: “You’ve changed his life”.</p><p>Others said the clip had left them in tears.</p><p>“I’m not crying – you’re crying,” said one commenter.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Another shared: “7:45am in the morning and I’m crying – absolutely beautiful.”</p><p>Mr McWaide told news.com.au he was immensely proud of the workplace culture his workers had created.</p><p><b><i>Share your acts of kindness – jack.evans@news.com.au</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmny4u9GkZpqsXay8s7eOnJynrKKWuW6vzpqqrWWTpMSwvsqeqaxll56ztXnSramun5ehtq%2BzjJ6kqaSfrrKmec2ermabkad8r7HWrGSsrJ%2BnxnB9k5qYcZuWbX%2BifMSdbptpkZh%2Ben2Ym2hrb2KZf3qEkA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
