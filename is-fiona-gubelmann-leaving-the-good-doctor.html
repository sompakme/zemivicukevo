After joining the show in a recurring role as Dr Morgan Reznick, the actress was quickly promoted to a series regular, but after six seasons on the show, is she planning to leave? Here's what we know…</p><h2 dir=ltr>Is Fiona Gubelmann leaving The Good Doctor?</h2><p id=eLU6hw5couu data-wc=59>Currently, there has been no mention of Fiona Gubelmann leaving The Good Doctor. Back in April, the 43-year-old celebrated the show's renewal for a seventh season, and her Instagram post suggests that she will be returning for the next instalment. The caption read: "Congratulations to everyone!! So excited for another season with our amazing @thegooddoctorabc family!!! @deadline #season7 #thegooddoctor."</p><p id=evVch5xyVMo data-wc=10><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Who is The Good Doctor star Freddie Highmore's wife?</a></strong></p><p id=eIJl0HQB5A data-wc=13><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The Diplomat fans express concern after Netflix confirms future of the show</a></p><p id=ekdLT2OxSUb data-wc=35>Over the past few weeks, fans of the show have been wondering if Fiona's character – Dr Morgan Reznick – might leave San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital to focus on raising her newly-adopted daughter Eden.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Alex convinces Morgan to stay at St. Bonaventure in The Good Doctor season six finale</figure><p id=eBtsXmt85vg data-wc=78>However, in the season six finale, Morgan decided to stay in her position at the hospital after Alex Park (played by Will Yun Lee) delivered a seriously romantic speech. "I don't think you should resign, because you don't have to do it all alone," he told her. "You're the reason I wake up in the morning, so whatever there is to figure out, all I want in the world is for us to do it as a family."&nbsp;</p><p id=eGolwwjxTiI data-wc=73>In one of the sweetest moments in the episode, Morgan and Alex then shared a passionate kiss before she hilariously handed Eden over to him. "She has a dirty diaper and I have 30 lab reports to review," Morgan said, before heading back to work. After the will-they-won't-they storyline between these two characters this season, it seems unlikely that Fiona would suddenly leave the show when their romance is finally back on track.&nbsp;</p><p id=ek5N_zM-lJ data-wc=26><strong>Don't want to miss a story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcGpuY2p8tbTEZp6op5RisbCv06ipZqGjYrOqu82aZKCtkpq5rq3Np2SlnZGrtq%2BzjKyfqK9dlsBusNFmpKiql5a7br7Es6Wim5tk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
