Fashion fans immediately had strong feelings about the look.</p><p>"She's so Prada. This makes sense," one fan commented under photos Clark re-shared on Instagram shortly after walking the carpet. "Prada her," another wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/krydwQxsFrt7pSJUSpiXBR-1920-80.jpg><p>The two-time national player of the year's look entailed a satin button-up shacket with a coordinating mini skirt. She wore her outermost layer unbuttoned to reveal a sparkly bralette top underneath. Her accessories all came dripping in Prada's triangle logo as well, from semi-translucent pink sunglasses to a tiny <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.marieclaire.com.au/fashion/top-handle-bags/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>top-handle bag</a> and pointed-toe <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g34847285/best-kitten-heels/>kitten heels</a>.</p><p>Speaking to reporters, Clark called the outfit a "special" moment within the bigger spectacle of her career-defining night. "I don't think Prada has ever fitted an NBA or WNBA player before [for the draft], so it's pretty special," she said.</p><p>Stylist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.azsn-studio.com/about-flatiron referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Adri Zgirdea Toth</a>, who specializes in dressing athletes for major signing events and pre-game tunnel walks, confirmed to Marie Claire that she coordinated Clark's Prada moment. "The look is elegant, classic, timeless, with a little extra sparkle, just like Caitlin," she says.</p><p>"Dressing an athlete for the draft is a first for Prada, and this is obviously a first for Caitlin, too. Both are at the forefront of what they do—it’s almost too perfect," Zgirdea Toth adds.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

The Italian luxury house is upping its investments in athlete partnerships both on and off the playing field across several major sports—sensing the potential to attract new fans by casting athletes as brand ambassadors.</p><p>Prada dressed the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://digiday.com/marketing/why-luxury-brands-like-prada-and-burberry-are-stepping-into-the-sports-arena/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Chinese national soccer team</a> for last year's World Cup; at the Bejiing Olympics in 2022, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/julia-marino-prada-snowboard-beijing-winter-olympics-1235063400/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>snowboarder Julia Marino</a> went viral for competing (and breaking regulations) with a Prada-branded snowboard. At the 2024 Paris Olympics, Prada and several other designers will be vying for athletes' attention and their outfit credits.</p><p>For now, fashion and sports fans can enjoy their worlds colliding in New York City—and watch as Caitlin Clark makes even more basketball history.
