Kwan reviewed the footage and found no reasonable way Hyland could legitimately fear being injured by her instructor.</p><p>“We are reviewing all options based upon the Court’s ruling, including an appeal,” Hyland’s attorney <strong>Michael Shapiro</strong> tells The Hollywood Reporter. Miller was represented by <strong>Jordan <span data-scayt_word=Grotzinger data-scaytid=1>Grotzinger</span></strong>, who declined to comment.</p><p>The Lifetime series, which premiered in 2011, centers on Miller’s interactions with the parents of her students in the Abby Lee Dance Company, which she founded and leads.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>The lawsuit from Hyland isn’t her family’s first legal dispute with Miller. <strong>Kelly Hyland</strong>, the mother of Paige and <strong>Brooke</strong>, who also appears on the series, <a href=# rel=noopener>sued Miller</a> in February 2014 related to an incident where Hyland was arrested for slapping Miller, allegedly because Miller tried to bite her.</p><p>She additionally claimed Miller defamed her by implying in media interviews she’s an alcoholic and an unfit mother, and said Miller’s “domineering and often bullying and insulting leadership style” constituted bullying and traumatized Paige into having panic attacks.</p><p>Kwan in November <a href=# rel=noopener>removed the claims</a> of defamation and infliction of emotional distress, ruling the girls’ mental state couldn’t conclusively be connected to Miller’s treatment. Hyland’s other claims, including negligence and breaches of contract, still are part of the case.</p><p><strong>July 16, 4:32 p.m.</strong> Updated with Hyland’s attorney’s comment on an appeal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmnZmemLJuuc6mqmaZkpfGbrjEnmSmoZyhsrN5kWZvaXFia39w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
