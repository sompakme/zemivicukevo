In an interview with Vlad TV, Yayo shared his perspective on the situation, revealing that he was unaware of 50's mocking comments about the Final Lap Tour. Moreover, in the interview, when Vlad brought up 50 Cent's comparison of Yayo's massive arena tour, where he served as a hypeman alongside Uncle Murda, to potentially less-attended shows by Banks and Buck, Yayo seemed taken aback. 50 said, "They think this is something? Wait ‘til they see <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lloyd Banks</a>’ tour." "I didn't even know he said that," Yayo responded when confronted with 50 Cent's remarks.</p><p>However, Vlad continued to probe, asking why Lloyd Banks and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Young Buck</a> were not part of 50's Final Lap Tour. Yayo chose not to delve into the specifics of Banks, emphasizing their friendship and Banks' apparent disapproval of Vlad. However, he shed some light on Young Buck's absence, suggesting that the dynamics were different for Buck, and decisions seemed to lean more towards him.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel>Tony Yayo Net Worth 2023: What Is The G-Unit Rapper Worth?</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tony-yayo-responds>Tony Yayo Responds</h2></span><p>Moreover, Yayo dismissed the comments.
