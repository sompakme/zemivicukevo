I’ve witnessed for YEARS how many people want to train these models to create/re-create actors who cannot consent, like Dad,” she wrote on her Instagram Story on Sunday. “This isn’t theoretical, it is very very real. I’ve already heard AI used to get his ‘voice’ to say whatever people want and while I find it personally disturbing, the ramifications go far beyond my own feelings.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Her comments come on the heels of the Writer Guild of America’s strike against the studios over issues that included the use of AI, among other sticking points. While the <a href=# id=auto-tag_wga data-tag=wga>WGA</a> has a tentative deal in place, <a href=# id=auto-tag_sag-aftra data-tag=sag-aftra>SAG-AFTRA</a> is still currently on strike over the use of AI and other issues.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Living actors deserve a chance to create characters with their choices, to voice cartoons, to put their HUMAN effort and time into the pursuit of performance,” Zelda continued in her post. “These re-creations are, at their very best, a poor facsimile of greater people, but at their worst, a horrendous Frankensteinian monster, cobbled together from the worst bits of everything this industry is, instead of what it should stand for.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Robin died by suicide in 2014 at age 62. He had been diagnosed previously with anxiety, severe depression and Parkinson’s disease; an autopsy revealed he also had Lewy body dementia.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Read Zelda’s full message below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zelda.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Robin’s voice is set to appear in a new Disney short, Once Upon a Studio, in the role of his Aladdin character, Genie. Josh Gad, the voice of Olaf in Disney’s Frozen, has confirmed that the short uses “previously unheard dialogue” recorded by Williams prior to his death and used with the consent of his estate. The short, which premiered at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in June and will be released later this month, brings together hundreds of Disney characters in celebration of the studio’s 100th anniversary.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcLDIoKCtmZxkv7CuyKdksKGcobaiudJmsZ6klJZ6pL7IraCcoaqawG6tyGapnpuimq61sYyhoKxlpqS2pLGMamlsbWZlgnl8lGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
