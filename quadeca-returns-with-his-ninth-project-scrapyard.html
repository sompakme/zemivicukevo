Today, we want to share Quadeca's new record, SCRAPYARD.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This is now his ninth overall project, with the first, Work in Progress, dropping way back in 2015. He is a rapper and singer, but not your conventional one. Quadeca likes to play around with different genres and subsets and that is what he does on SCRAPYARD. This project has actually been in progress since October of last year.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-scrapyard-by-quadeca>Listen To SCRAPYARD By Quadeca</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Over a month span or so, Quadeca was dropping small packages of songs and titling the EPs SCRAPYARD I, II, and III. Eight tracks were previewed in total. According to its Genius page, he was going to drop two more entries, but decided to scrap that idea (pun intended). The songs have been resonating so much with his fans, that the top five tracks on his Spotify are all taken up by SCRAPYARD cuts. There are a lot of uniquely beautiful and somber moments such "U DON'T KNOW ME LIKE THAT" <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"TEXAS BLUE"</a> with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kevin Abstract</a> and more.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on this brand-new album, SCRAPYARD, by Quadeca?
