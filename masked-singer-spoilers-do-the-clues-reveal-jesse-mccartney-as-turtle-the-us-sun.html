The US Sun</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>EVERY new batch of clues about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Masked Singer</a>'s Turtle only proves more and more that Jesse McCartney is under the mask.</p><p>After many weeks of evidence, the identity of the costumed contestant is becoming less and less secret.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000574584970.jpg><p>In the last episode, Turtle revealed he's been a major fan of panelist Robin Thicke for years, and Jesse covered Robin’s song The Stupid Things on his debut solo album in 2004.</p><p>The costumed singer also said he was "geeking out" over Robin, and the former boybander had a geeky role on sitcom Young & Hungry.</p><p>Plus, a "Back" street could be in reference to Jesse opening up for the Backstreet Boys on multiple tours, and his giant diamond ring might be a clue about the actor's recent engagement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/MS-S3_EP316-Show-MB_0076.jpg><p>Turtle said being in costume makes him feel like a "superhero," before later shining a batman-like light in the sky, and Jesse voices the comic book superhero character Dick Grayson in the animated Young Justice series.</p><p>A "wanted" sign had a reward for $1,999, and 1999 was the year the pop star joined boyband Dream Street.</p><p>The clue package also showed husband and wife figures on a truck's dashboard, and Jesse and his longtime girlfriend Katie Peterson recently got engaged.</p><p>Two other pieces of evidence popped out — the red, blue and green poker chips, like the colors the chipmunks wear in Alvin and the Chipmunks, which Jesse voice-starred in, and a zombie mannequin, and the actor was in Fear the Walking Dead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/MS-S3_EP315-Show-MB_0482.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/MS-S3_EP315-Show-MB_0468-1.jpg><p>In a previous episode, the Turtle's clue package was set on a chess board and there, on the giant game, was a big <span class=s1>red heart with a silver tiara, which </span>was similar to the logo for the Kingdom Hearts video game Jesse does voice work for.</p><p>There was also&nbsp;<span class=s1>Vintage 1879 clock, and if those numbers are rearranged, they become the pop singer's birth year: 1987.</span></p><p>Later, the masked contestant said "Checkmate," and Jesse has a song with the same title off of his In Technicolor album.</p><p>His Masked Munchies clue was a "colorful medley of chips with an apple salsa," and the chips were red, blue and green, again, like the colors of Alvin and the Chipmunks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-05-05-at-5.14.27-PM.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-05-05-at-5.14.42-PM.png><p>Before that, Turtle went up against Astronaut and said: "W<span class=s1>e gotta see which one of us can stand out in this heartthrob throwdown."</span></p><p>With Astronaut likely singer Hunter Hayes, it would make sense that both are considered heartthrobs.</p><p>Plus, "stand out" might be a nod to Jesse's Outstanding Child Actor and Younger Actor nominations for All My Children at Soap Opera Digest Awards and the Daytime Emmy Awards.</p><p>The masked singer said he's had his "fair share" of heartbreak, and the 33-year-old has been linked to many stars, including Danielle panabaker, Katie Cassidy, Sara Paxton and more before getting engaged to his now-fiance Katie Peterson.</p><p>The item clues later featured also pointed to the Dream Street alum, with the “never keep open this bag” tag, aka NKOTB, and diagonal arrow, aka One Direction, both let fans know the singer was in a boyband.</p><p>There was also a crown image, which, like a later clue, was similar to the Kingdom Heart image, and it could reference his role in a production of The King and I when he was younger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000574584419.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000574584536.jpg><p>The gavel could be for the actor's guest roles on both Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU, and the baseball glove's because Jesse was on a baseball team when he was growing up and used to dream of going pro.</p><p>The perfume bottle? In 2011, he came out with the women's fragrance Wanted By Jesse.</p><p>The week before, he mentioned being a “method actor,” and Jesse is known for being not only a singer but an actor, as well.</p><p>Plus, he said he was running with a 40-lb pound weight in preparation of wearing the Turtle shell and said that was a quarter of his weight.</p><p>The Wasted singer allegedly weighs about 160 pounds.</p><p>His next “fantastic confession” was “not another TEENy clue.”</p><p>Turtle showed off a comic book that had himself on the cover and the title “The Amazing Adventures of Shellboy,” as well as the question, “Who’s the Hero Under the Mask?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000574584537.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000574584538.jpg><p>It also had the issue edition, “S10.13,” listed.</p><p>As mentioned, Jesse is in Young Justice — about teen heroes — and he originally voiced his character from 2010-13, aka “S10.13,” before recently reprising the role.</p><p>The first three clue packages provided even more evidence of Jesse being the Turtle.</p><p>The Masked Singer episode 1 had him “surrounded by other hungry newcomers,” aka Jesse’s fellow Dream Street members.</p><p>He said he saw “too many of those stars burn too brightly,” and the 32-year-old has a song titled "The Second Star to the Right," and that he’s taken it "step by step,” and Jesse’s called his boyband a “stepping stone” before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000574584418.jpg><p>The costumed character holds up a surfboard, which could be referencing the actor-singer’s Summerland series, or his Teen Choice Awards.</p><p>He briefly walked like a zombie, and Jessie was in Fear the Walking dead.</p><p>Turtle earned a gold medal in the clip, and Dream Street and solo Jesse earned gold records and certifications.</p><p>In the second clue package, ginger snaps are on the school food menu, and Ginger is Jesse’s mom’s name.</p><p>The can of POP on a lunch table could refer to him being known as a pop star, as well as the So Pop festival he was originally scheduled to perform at in Australia in May.</p><p>He drops all of his food in the cafeteria, which might be in reference to his role on Young & Hungry.</p><p>Turtle rocked out with all the lights changing colors, like Jesse’s music project, In Technicolor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000560762826.jpg><p>He got in trouble and had to write “Don’t rave ever at my school -Turtle” on a chalkboard, and the first letter of each word spells out Dream St.</p><p>His final episode 2 clue was that he was voted “most likely to hunt for booty,” and the 32-year-old singer used the word “booty” in his song Up and the phrase “That thing you got behind you is amazing” is amazing.</p><p>His Fear the Walking Dead character was also in a group called Connor’s Pirates, and Jesse was in the video short The Pirates of Central Park and voiced a character in The Pirate Fairy.</p><p>Turtle also said <span>“You can punish me all you want for being myself, but if I want to sing a love song, I’m gonna sing a love song," and Jesse wrote Bleeding Love but it was given to Leona Lewis instead of him getting to record it himself.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000574584445.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/04/NINTCHDBPICT000574584448.jpg><p>As for episode 3, the football field and then greek symbols on the chalkboard point to Jesse’s role as a footballer and pledge on college drama Greek.</p><p>The map on the wall focuses on Seoul, which is pronounced like “soul” and Jesse has popular song Beautiful Soul, as well as his more recent tune, simply Soul.</p><p>Turtle’s teacher ended the video by hoping he has the “time of [his] life,” and Jesse starred in the Lifetime movie Expecting Amish and on the network’s show Army Wives.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN ENTERTAINMENT NEWS</h2></p><p>Turtle ended that episode by telling panelist Nicole Scherzinger he’d “never forget” the morning they spent together, and they both performed on the same episode of NBC’s morning show Today in 2008.</p><p><a href=#
