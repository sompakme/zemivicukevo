You may have already visited the U.S. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/a40837240/biologique-recherche-los-angeles-store-opening/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Ambassade class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Ambassade</u></a> in Los Angeles for a skin-transforming treatment, but on the product front, it just launched a new <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/skin-care/a38867912/eighth-day-moisturizer-review/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="regenerating serum" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>regenerating serum</u></a> that changes everything we know about collagen. Following its research and development team's discovery of an ancient and previously undiscovered form of collagen, the brand developed a patented, shelf-stable active ingredient that's the star of the new serum. Known for the cult-favorite Lotion P50 toner and the often-wait-listed Masque Vivant, fans of the luxury line can shop the new <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biologique-recherche.com/en-us/skin-care/cosmetic-preparation/Collagene-Originel/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Collagène Originel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Collagène Originel</a> today.</p><h2 data-node-id=1 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>How Does the Serum Work?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dr. Philippe Allouche, son of the founders and head of creation at Biologique Recherche, explains that the serum works to redensify the skin three-dimensionally by promoting the production of four types of collagen (of which there are 28 types total). That sounds like a lot of numbers, but the end result is this: smoother skin and reduced wrinkles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As you well know, your skin's production of collagen naturally declines with age, adversely impacting firmness, smoothness, tightness, and plumpness. Thus, this serum was designed especially for skin conditions (what the brand dubs Skin Instants) with existing lines and wrinkles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The formula harnesses the effects of the brand's star ingredient, Type-0 Collagen, along with botanical silene extract, soybean glycopeptides, and green microalgae, to encourage collagen types I, III, IV, and VII. Promoting types I and III (the most abundant forms of collagen in the skin) increases overall density, while types IV and VII improve the integrity of something called the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's the complex structure that anchors the epidermis layer to the dermis layer, and keeps skin plump and youthful. The serum lengthens and improves the DEJ while increasing the dermal layer," Allouche tells BAZAAR.com. This encourages the cell exchanges in the DEJ that decline with age, yielding noticeably regenerated skin.</p><a href=# rel=nofollow><img alt="biologique collagen serum" title="biologique collagen serum" width=1200 height=940 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/high350165-462988-931774-1665507459.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="clickable-image-button e1fodxfw0 css-z4m2uo e12nq69g1">SHOP</span></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">BIOLOGIQUE RECHERCHE</span></p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>What Is Type-0 Collagen?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This so-called "mother of all collagens" was found under the sea in a primitive marine planktonic organism, which Allouche describes as having not evolved in more than 600 million years. "It is so old that it constitutes the historical strain of all collagens," he says. "This is why we speak of Type-0 as the original basis of collagen."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All collagen is made up of amino acids, but this form contains amino acids threonine, serine, leucine, and tyrosine in high levels, as well as small amounts of cysteine. Among other things, topical amino acids can aid with skin health and qualities like water retention, cellular repair, the reduction of inflammation, and, of course, the production of collagen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Due to its unique components, however, the challenge was finding a way to make the active ingredient shelf-stable at room temperature. "Like other marine collagens, [which are] generally from fish, Type-0 Collagen contains less hydroxyproline and proline than bovine collagen, hence less thermal stability. [However] it is perfectly stabilized in our formula and can be stored at room temperature," he says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Years of research on skin's health led the brand to look back at the origins of collagen. "There was a certain level of epiphany during this research. All living beings on our planet are the result of complex mutations. Just like them, the collagen in our skin has evolved over the centuries, becoming increasingly differentiated into 28 types of human collagen," Allouche says. "We decided to dig deep into the origins of collagen, [which is where we found] the historical strain of all collagen types—the original base in its raw state—and its extraordinary benefits for the skin."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Biologique Recherche's Collagène Originel is available to shop now at the flagship in Los Angeles or online at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biologique-recherche.com/en-us/skin-care/cosmetic-preparation/Collagene-Originel/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=mybr.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">mybr.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqyjmaN6pK3RnmaabGFqhXiBk3Jmm6GfobyotdCunGaqlZi1pr7CoZxmm5%2BhuaKzxKdkrJ2iqrpw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
