In 2014, Lopez pitched Shades of Blue, a gritty drama about a single mother and NYPD detective who gets involved with a cabal of dirty cops, to NBC. She was wearing her producer hat only, and had no intention of starring in the series, but those plans quickly changed.</p><p>"They were like, 'Why are you not playing this role?'" Lopez told <a href=#>Stuff</a>. "And I thought to myself, 'I don't know, maybe...maybe I should.'" And so she did, taking on the lead role of the conflicted Harlee Santos (opposite Ray Liotta), and NBC <a href=#>ordered up a first season</a>. As Lopez was still quite busy with her movie and music careers, Shades of Blue's production schedule was <a href=#>quite accommodating</a>, what with its first two seasons consisting of a relatively low 13 episodes each. Still, when the show was renewed for a third season, Lopez was already eyeballing the end. "We always knew this would have a finite run," she told <a href=#>IndieWire</a>. "When we got to the third season, I was like, 'I think we're done with this.' And the way the season ends, I think this is it. ... It seemed perfect to move on to the next chapter for me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanBmZ390e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5yZ6lp6GWmr9uuM6pnLNn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
