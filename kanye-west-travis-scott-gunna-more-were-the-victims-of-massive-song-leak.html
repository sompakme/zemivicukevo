In fact, one song in particular caught the attention of fans. This song is about eight years old and is called "Can U Be." It is a collaboration between Kanye and Travis Scott, with the full song making the rounds on Twitter, Sunday evening.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As per HHNM's reporting, there was a Group Buy that was started by someone on Discord. For those who are not familiar, a Group Buy is a group auction of sorts with a set goal. In this case, the goal was $25,000. If the goal was reached, then all of the music would get leaked to the group. Well, the goal was reached extremely fast. In fact, there were some people willing to donate thousands of dollars on an individual level. That is a lot of money, but leaks have always proven to be valuable.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kanye-west-x-travis-scott-collab-hits-twitter>Kanye West x Travis Scott Collab Hits Twitter</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It was noted that among these leaks are actual stems, which means producers can do as they please with the tracks. Moreover, some of the songs that were leaked have already released, however, these are simply alternate versions. Needless to say, if you are a music nerd or a super fan, there is going to be a lot here for you to digest. However, we do not recommend engaging with leaks. If the artist wanted you to hear these songs, they would have released them by now.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think about this leak, in the comments section down below.
