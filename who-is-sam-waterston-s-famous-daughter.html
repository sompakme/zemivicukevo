She reprised the role in the 2018 sequel "The Crimes of Grindelwald," and will definitely appear again in 2022's "Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore" â€” though <a href=#>her absence from the trailer</a> confused and worried some fans. Fear not, muggles: Tina is too important to the franchise, particularly as Newt's love interest and eventual wife, not to appear in the film.</p><p>But while Tina may be the role Katherine is best known for, it certainly wasn't her first. She also starred in the Joaquin Phoenix-led film <a href=#>"Inherent Vice,"</a> directed by Paul Thomas Anderson in 2014, and made her big-screen debut in 2007's "Michael Clayton," opposite megastar George Clooney. She also had a recurring role as Emma Harrow in the HBO series "Boardwalk Empire," and appeared in the films "Alien: Covenant" and "Sleeping with Other People," <a href=#>among others</a>.</p><p>Surprisingly, Katherine didn't get her start on "Law & Order," despite her father's connection to the show. When <a href=# savefrom_lm_index=0 savefrom_lm=1>Jimmy Fallon</a><span></span> asked her if she'd worked with Dad on the show, she groaned. "This is like one of those moments where I wish I could come up with some fake news on the spot," she said. But no, despite auditioning several times, she claimed, "I couldn't even get a callback on that show."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcGljZoJ2e9ahpmaho2LAormMsJitnaKowbC60madmqWfqsBusMCunqGslad8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
