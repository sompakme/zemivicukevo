This has changed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, sources told People that Sarkozy is a "party boy and a big spender" who "loves the high life," while Olsen "prefers to be quiet and alone and doing the things she likes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She’s not that interested in socializing — she likes small gatherings with select people," a source said. "They ended up being apart quite a bit."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier this month, it was reported that Olsen requested an emergency divorce from Sarkozy after nearly five years of marriage. The coronavirus pandemic had halted divorce proceedings in New York City; Olsen reportedly filed a petition for divorce on April 17, but courts are only processing "emergency" filings. Sarkozy's legal team had asked that she remove her belongings from their New York City apartment by May 18, but Olsen said it wasn't safe to be moving amid the pandemic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In court documents, she claimed that Sarkozy was "forcing" her out of the premises by terminating their lease without her knowing, and requested an extension to May 30.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am petrified that my husband is trying to deprive me of the home that we have lived in and if he is successful, I will not only lose my home but I risk losing my personal property as well," she wrote in the filing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A judge has since deemed Olsen's request non-essential, and her petition has been denied. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Michael Katz denied the motion because "essential matter procedure" was not followed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGedlr%2B6ecqaq55ln6HAprqMqKOirpmav26%2FwKuiqLKpYsCxuMitZJ2dpJa2rb8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
