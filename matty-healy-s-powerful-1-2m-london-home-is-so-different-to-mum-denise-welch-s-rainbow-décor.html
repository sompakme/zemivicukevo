It’s so empty but also not too much is going on. Very calming, relaxed vibes so it balances it all out and I think that’s beautiful."</p><p id=eR56M9SAooe data-wc=5>See inside his home below…</p><p id=eB2ARu1hqw9 data-wc=36>Visually minded with strong creative inspiration, it's no surprise that Matty had a clear vision for his home – which couldn't be more different from the kaleidoscope of colour in his mother <a class=hm-link href=#>Denise Welch's Cheshire home</a><strong>.</strong></p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=e23a4Kngx5P data-wc=25>While Matty's home would likely appeal to Kim Kardashian and her penchant for an <a class=hm-link href=#>empty, neutrally-coloured home</a>, we wondered how Matty's all-grey palette impacts him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f893cb93e8e2-matty-healy.jpg><p id=eT9lHm5WuIE data-wc=17>HELLO! spoke to<a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;furniture designer and colour consultant Emma Diaz</a> for her verdict on his monochrome abode.</p><p id=e1locDlRnGY data-wc=57>"Some people may feel a monochrome home is strong, powerful and calm," Emma says. "It can feel clean but also sterile if we are not careful - so adding natural textures through exposed natural materials in wood finishes, rattan baskets and plants and even warm brass finishes to help keep it looking hotel chic and not drab."</p><p id=ehkwbGBoxs data-wc=13><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Matty Healy’s dating history - All the women he’s been linked to</a><strong><br></strong></p><p id=eMRkqMimcnP data-wc=45>Emma adds that industrial and utilitarian grey has become a less popular choice for interiors recently.
