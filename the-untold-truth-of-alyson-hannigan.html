She was also supposed to work with one of her daughters on the show, but the timing wasn't quite right.</p><p>When Hannigan was pregnant with her oldest daughter, Satyana Marie Denisof, in 2008 and 2009, the "HIMYM" writers weren't quite ready to add a child into the mix on the series. In addition to often hiding her baby bump, they explained its presence away in creative and fun ways â€” such as when, in one episode, her character, Lily Aldrin, wins a hot-dog eating contest. By the time Hannigan got pregnant again in 2011, Lily was also expecting, and Hannigan was&nbsp;ready to give her daughter, Keeva Jane Denisof, an early introduction to acting. However, co-creator Carter Bays decided that Keeva had aged out of the role of Marshall (Jason Segel) and Lily's baby, Marvin, when it came time to shoot his scenes. "First of all, that's ageism. I don't think you're allowed to fire her because she's too old," Hannigan joked to <a href=#>HuffPost</a>.</p><p>Hannigan told BuzzFeed that the baby who replaced Keeva was Bays' daughter. She believes this is why the producer gave in and let her keep the phone booth prop when they were fighting over it after the series wrapped. "His baby was like six months younger. So, it was his baby. But I got the phone booth, so fair trade," she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxhaYN5gI6upa2nnJl6tb7UrZ9mmZyuwLC6jKGYp6aZnK6vew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
