Well, that's all over now. This morning, the duo made a joint appearance on the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Today</a>&nbsp;show to tell everyone that the gang is back together and that all the stories that had circulated about a vicious fight between the two were greatly exaggerated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“After seeing the same clickbait story over and over and over on Instagram about how much we hated each other, I was like, ‘I can’t take this anymore.’ Because we don’t really hate each other. We love each other, as a matter of fact,” Kelly said during their segment. “We have very strong feelings toward each other. So I reached out to Stacy and I was like, ‘Can we put this behind us? Let’s talk it out.’ And we had a really emotional conversation. It was during the pandemic, sort of as the pandemic was ending. And we just talked through it all.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I sobbed my eyes out,” London added. "I let it all hang out. I told Clinton everything that made me sad, everything that hurt me, every way I thought I hurt him. All the petty grudges, all the stupid crap.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What Not to Wear&nbsp;ran from 2003 to 2013. Later, in 2017, fans noticed that Kelly had blocked London on Twitter, which is now known as X. Kelly wasn't subtle about their relationship in the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>collection of essays</a>&nbsp;that published, writing that he “either adored her or despised her, and never anything in between.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think part of that is, you know, what I said about evolution. When you grow up a little bit — and we did <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>grow up together</a> on television — there was a lot of points of pride that I don’t think either of us were willing to cop to,” London said today.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The two also announced that they're going on tour together, giving fans one more chance to see that signature "chemistry."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Now, we’ve decided, we have this great chemistry, we make each other laugh, we finish each other’s sentences, why aren’t we sharing this with the world? So we’re going on tour,” Kelly said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>10-city live tour</a>&nbsp;will kick off in Birmingham, Alabama, on Oct. 5 and finish its run in Austin, Texas, on Oct. 18.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Donna Svennevik/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We’re going to stand up and we’re going to talk about the behind-the-scenes stories of&nbsp;What Not to Wear,’” Kelly said of the show.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Lots of goss!” London promised.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For anyone wondering whether or not the show will address their feud, rest easy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The big feud, we’ll go through that,” Kelly said. “We’ll do lots of audience participation, like if people want style advice, our updated style advice.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570q2YnLFdobyvsM6nZJykmaPBsLqMpJylpKliv6bBzaKmp2WkpMKzeZZybm9oY2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
