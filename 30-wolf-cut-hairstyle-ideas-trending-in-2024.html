"I specifically recommend it for those with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/celebrity-haircuts-thin-hair/>thinner hair</a> because it’ll give the appearance of fuller hair."</p><p>Still, one of the reasons wolf cuts have stayed so popular is because they work for everyone.

With her <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/billie-eilish-blonde-hair-thoughts/>blonde era behind her</a>, she's still loving the cut...albeit with a slightly softer feel these days. If you ask your hairstylist for a Billie-inspired chop, you'll almost certainly walk out with a new edge. Maybe they'll even convince you to get the lime green roots, too?</p><h2 id=short-wolf-cut-3>Short Wolf Cut&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3ooVwAHJRcsZixGdrfLfog-1920-80.jpg><p>"Since the bob is so popular this year, I think an amazing way to update the wolf cut is to make it shorter!" says Giannetos. And of course he's right.</p><p>If you have more of a bob or <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/hair/g2510/best-lobs-haircut/>lob haircut</a>, consider trying a cut like <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/miley-cyrus/>Miley Cyrus</a>'s blonde look above. Her mini-mullet wolf cut is full of voluminous texture (a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-dry-texturizers/>dry texturizer</a> can help!) that perfectly matches her rock-and-roll persona.</p><h2 id=curly-wolf-cut-5>Curly Wolf Cut&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F6X4KPWF3hpyHzJVJgXzNJ-1920-80.jpg><p>Friends with curly hair, look no further than Rita Ora's shaggy wolf cut to inspire your next chop. The texture is perfectly defined thanks to the layers and, as you can see, the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/celebrity-bang-hair-trend-2023/>bangs</a> are also doing some major work to keep the curl pattern front and center. Hint: If you're going for this cut, make sure you plan your trim appointments ahead of time so your forehead doesn't suffer in the summer heat.</p><h2 id=heavily-layered-wolf-cut-3>Heavily Layered Wolf Cut</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8EX5TrsuQnMFRCEiRo5igP-1920-80.jpg><p>Even if you didn't know how cool Yellowjackets Sophie Thatcher is, you'd be able to tell from her hairstyle, a classic wolf cut with structure that makes her cheekbones pop and incredible height. With major layers around her face, the actress's locks reach all the way to her waist in a display of shaggy perfection—it's a cut so good she even kept it for her role in the movie of the summer, MaXXXine.</p><h2 id=choppy-wolf-cut-3>Choppy Wolf Cut&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SvUA9v5VynJCs9GXzvmSsQ-1920-80.jpg><p>One of the most dramatic wolf-cuts that we've ever seen is Doja Cat's from the 2021 Grammy Awards.

If you want to make even less extreme of a change, take a cue from the artist and grab a wig. As another short wolf cut and wig proponent, Miley Cyrus, would say, it's the best of both worlds.</p><h2 id=piece-y-wolf-cut-3>Piece-y Wolf Cut</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jovD3SLMpdfdkPbTjjqPCA-1920-80.jpg><p>If you're still a little confused about the structure of a wolf cut, let this photo be your guide. As Abramite explained earlier, the longer layers are disconnected from the front of the hair by the choppiness of the front layer, adding movement to the look as a whole.</p><h2 id=shaggy-wolf-cut-3>Shaggy Wolf Cut</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yPHFRWnec4c7qi85no83jP-1920-80.jpg><p>Combine the wolf cut with a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/hair/g32162293/summer-hair-colors/>summer hair color</a> trend, Bardot blonde, and you have Renee Rapp's edgy style. Never one to go soft with the layers, her signature wolf cut is one of the best examples we have of the style—if you're looking for pre-salon inspiration, just scroll through the singer's <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/reneerapp/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Instagram page</a>.

I mean, look at that texture! The cut—which she's had for years in different iterations—is also on the longer end, so it serves as a great example of how to change up your below-shoulder-length hair.

While the major choppy layers here initially offer an optical illusion, her hair actually isn't that short. That's just the magic of the cut!</p><h2 id=loosely-styled-wolf-cut-3>Loosely Styled Wolf Cut</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bv7SSK9CWCsFiSgjLbvCDA-1920-80.jpg><p>If you're not ready for a full-on wolf cut, you can pay homage to the shape by including some choppy layers in your style. This shag by Giannetos is a great example: though she hasn't fully committed to the style, Dixie D'Amelio still has that rock star edge.</p><h2 id=voluminous-wolf-cut-3>Voluminous Wolf Cut</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RxuGdPHJ44rkN48WaMVbaM-1920-80.jpg><p>To get J.Lo's look, hairstylist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.thewallgroup.com/artist/lorenzo-martin/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Lorenzo Martin</a> began by creating texture throughout the artist's strands, later adding in blunt bangs that begin just below her brows and blend beautifully through her impressive, shaggy layers (no length was sacrificed).</p><h2 id=soft-wolf-cut-3>Soft Wolf Cut</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SGpfbAhTHhL2cnFSb3oAsM-1920-80.jpg><p>Contrary to popular belief, the wolf cut and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/jenner-sisters-soft-girl-beauty/>soft girl beauty</a> trend can go hand in hand. Here, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/kaia-gerber/>Kaia Gerber</a> shows off a gentle approach to the style with soft waves that extend just to her shoulders. But make no mistake, those major layers are there—zoom in near her chin for proof. In true soft girl fashion, a sweep of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-brown-mascara/>brown mascara</a> seals the deal.</p><h2 id=pixie-length-wolf-cut-3>Pixie Length Wolf Cut</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BG4KohzwbrDScVinEBWaqM-1920-80.jpg><p>No, you don't have to choose between two <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/hair-trends-2024/>2024 hair trends</a>—the magic is finding a stylist that makes everything you're interested in work as one. Here, Halsey shows off an ethereal <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/pixie-cuts/>pixie cut</a>/wolf cut hybrid that's as elegant as it is funky.

A straightforward wolf cut in many ways (as straightforward as a wolf cut can be, anyway), the Hocus Pocus 2 actress chose a shorter length...but didn't at all sacrifice the number of layers present.

While we won't deny that the bleach blonde shade is adding something mighty special to the look, it's also worth noting that the lack of bangs isn't taking anything away. Yet another shaggy take on the wolf cut, this is a style to consider if you're not obsessed with fringe.</p><h2 id=softly-curled-wolf-cut-3>Softly Curled Wolf Cut</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PiMPSxPXtLVZbFEKdrsyfM-1920-80.jpg><p>While we often see wolf cuts with messy textures and "I woke up like this" energy, this softly curled version on Barbie Ferreira is a refreshing change of pace. With some of the layers pinned back, the model and Euphoria actress's dark strands fall softly over her shoulders in perfect tendrils.
