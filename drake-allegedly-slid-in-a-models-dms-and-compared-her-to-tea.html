Normally that comes consensually, when a fellow celebs shares a screenshot of their messages. But other times it's a bit more unexpected for everyone involved. That was probably the case for <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> when a recent DM that he allegedly sent hit the internet. There's no guarantee that the screenshot is legit but that didn't stop fans from cracking up over what it said.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A screenshot was shared online allegedly from an Instagram model who received a DM from the rapper's champagnepapi Instagram account. But it wasn't just the fact that Drake was DMing her that got her attention, it's what the message actually says. "Your body is absolute tea" his message reads. In the screenshot she shared she hasn't even accepted the message from the massively successful rapper yet, much less crafted a response. The DM sparked a frenzy of fans online thinking about how they would react in a similar situation. Check out the alleged message screenshot below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-allegedly-dming-instagram-model>Drake Allegedly DMing Instagram Model</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this week, news emerged that Drake was trying to sever his connection the Astroworld Festival tragedy. The event is still very much being processed in the courts and Drizzy wants out of the legal matters. He claimed via his lawyers that he <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"wasn't involved in any planning"</a> for the festival and therefore shouldn't be held responsible for the lapses in safety.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this week, Drake took to Instagram to hype up PARTYNEXTDOOR. The OVO singer has a new song dropping later this week and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Drizzy was hyping him up on Instagram</a>. He also described the R&B singer as the real goat. What do you think of Drake allegedly DMing a model on Instagram and claiming her body is "absolute tea?" Do you think the DM is real or a faked screenshot?
