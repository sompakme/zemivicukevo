He was a hit, and Czar Nicholas I awarded Petipa after his first performance with a ruby and diamond ring. He thrilled audiences, as described by <a href=#>American Ballet Theatre</a>, collaborating with the Austrian ballerina&nbsp;Fanny Elssler in ballets such as&nbsp;Paquita.</p><p dir=ltr>Elssler herself was a star, with&nbsp;<a href=#>Dance Research Journal</a>&nbsp;describing her "swooning, voluptuous arms" that emphasized her gems, laces, and satins with a certain materialism.&nbsp;<a href=#>Ballet in Russia</a>&nbsp;provides a glimpse of Elssler's impact on her audiences as she introduced Spanish-style dances to the Russia. She was so impressive that the Imperial Ballet signed her to contract for three seasons. She was more grounded than earlier ballerinas, with one witness declaring,&nbsp;"Madame Elssler offered a sunny, precise, natural and simply elegant type of dancing; ennobling it, she freed the theatre from the former showy jumps."</p><p dir=ltr>As for Petipa, he became so entranced by Russia that he became a citizen. This is no wonder, since the Imperial court, according to the <a href=#>Cambridge Companion</a>, treated foreign artists many times better than the Russians who worked under them. Petipa, however, found most lasting fame by enthralling audiences with his productions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Fl21sb29frLWiwIyiq2avkah6s7HApaOyZZyeuKZ506hkmqykmruledOhnGahnaWys7XApWSbmZyhsrV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
