Wyatt on Tuesday sent The Hollywood Reporter a statement in response to the suit, which said the plaintiffs are unwilling to accept that Cosby “was vindicated by the [Pennsylvania] State Supreme Court almost a year and a half ago.” He says, “As we have always stated, and now America can see, this isn’t about justice for victims of alleged sexual assault, it’s ALL ABOUT MONEY. We believe that the courts, as well as the court of public opinion, will follow the rules of law and relieve Mr. Cosby of these alleged accusations. Mr. Cosby continues to vehemently deny all allegation waged against him and looks forward to defending himself in court.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">NBCUniversal declined to comment, as is their policy on pending legal matters. Carsey-Werner and Kaufman Astoria have not yet responded to a request for comment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Shortly after the one-year window to file claims under New York’s Adult Survivors Act opened on Nov. 24 Donald Trump was sued by E. Jean Carroll and multiple suits have been filed against Atlantic&nbsp;Records&nbsp;and the Estate of Ahmet Ertegun. On Monday, director James Toback was sued under the same law by 38 women who accuse him of varying levels of sexual misconduct, along with the Harvard Club of New York City which they allege was complicit in allowing his behavior to go unchecked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKO1y6VknKejl8ZuusGcrKehppq%2FtK3LZqqunZRiv6K8xGaYpaSVnK61tc6nqmZpYmiCc4OVamxuZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
