Season 7? TLC released <a href=#>a first-look video</a>, and there's plenty of drama and entertainment, that's for sure. Jenny and Sumit admit their vastly different upbringings and cultures have caused "a lot of ups and downs." However, they finally came together as husband and wife during a traditional Indian wedding ceremony. Cue the family freak outs.</p><p dir=ltr>Ed insists he keeps Liz "on her toes." However, she appears to be wielding all the power as he lies face down while she rips wax strips off his incredibly hairy back. "There's never a dull moment with Ed," Liz admits. It certainly wasn't dull when he placed a giant sparkler on her ring finger. However, will Ed ever slide a gold band on there too? Kim says she couldn't care less about people's opinions of Usman being 18 years younger than her. But, she's not so happy about his plans for a second wife.</p><p dir=ltr>An angry and frustrated Angela continues to feel neglected in Georgia. Not so fast, though. She's got a hot new flirt buddy on the go. Michael has some serious competition, especially in the hips department. A heartbroken and anxious Andrei and Elizabeth suspect somebody is meddling and trying to get him deported. Meanwhile, Jovi and Yara's marriage struggles continue, and it looks like they won't cease if her mean girlfriends have any say in the matter.</p><p dir=ltr>&nbsp;You definitely won't want to miss this upcoming season.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm1lZoZxe5hpZJ2ZqWKzqq3NnJxmoJGlvaq42Gacr52iYq6nwMSrZKydkai8r3mWZqmepJWWwKZ5w5qrnmWTlsC1ecCnm2aln6eybrXNn6arpZGptrC6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
