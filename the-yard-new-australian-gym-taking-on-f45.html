You don’t have to be one, but it brings out the inner athlete in everybody,” Mr Bova explained.</p><p>Cult gym franchise F45, meanwhile, continues to experience a staggering fall from grace.</p><p>The fitness industry has endured a massive shake-up in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, with many gyms — and <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=edd793499f93a9461ee81b5209408ac3 data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>building companies</a>, and <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=3ec2f54fa4b7bb2f537665c0bf1fb948 data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>fashion labels</a>, and <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=8b2b0fe6523a3cac1169e44a3b25829e data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>furniture brands</a> — going bust as cost of living soars.</p><p><a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=77f6ca8ce08e6fd434c29acedffb3fe6 data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>At least 11</a> F45 Training gyms, known for their 45-minute functional high intensity interval training classes, have ceased operating amid mass staff lay-offs and resignations from board members.</p><p>The highest individual liabilities for a now-defunct F45 gym was almost $600,000, as F45-branded equipment was <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=0e79a618951ad0178c46c3b0f1846f21 data-tgev-label=finance data-tgev-metric=ev>flogged on Facebook Marketplace</a> in an attempt to recoup the losses.</p><p>Though The Yard is frequently touted as the “new F45”— potentially daunting, given the cult gym’s current struggles — Mr Bova said he was grateful to the company for teaching him “what to do and not do”.</p><p>“I’m really thankful for the time that I spent with them (F45). What they’ve done for the fitness industry has really set the pathway for what we’re doing today,” he said.</p><p>“I learned a lot, what to do and what not to do … I’m not too sure about their current status, but in my eyes it’s probably not important. They created history.”</p><p>The Bovas credit The Yard’s ongoing success in the struggling market to their ability to “stay nimble”.</p><p>In fact, the couple signed the lease on their first location in Caringbah just two weeks before NSW’s first lockdown, and successfully rode out a dismal few years that have sunk a number of Aussie small businesses.</p><p>Mr Bova said they used the successive lockdowns to “market really well” via online and outdoor workout options, building a social media following that kept the brand afloat while their doors were closed.</p><p>The Caringbah location was matched with expansions to Wollongong, Heathcote and Peakhurst. Now, The Yard has opened two international locations with a pair of gyms in San Diego, California, launched after a contact expressed an interest in tapping the US market.</p><p>The first San Diego location had more than 400 inquiries within two weeks of opening, Mr Bova said.</p><p>Surprisingly, the couple does plan on stopping. In fact, they claim they are going for quality over quantity, and will max out at 250 franchises Australia-wide.</p><p>“We’re not a saturation model,” Mr Bova explained.</p><p>“We work on making sure that our franchisees have enough reach in terms of their territories, and enough support to keep going long-term … We’re really about making sure that we keep a high quality of gyms and standards.”</p><p>What makes the franchise different, Mr Bova said, was its “wow factor”.</p><p>“Our training programs allow our coaches to be coaches and not cheerleaders, as per some other models,” he explained.</p><p>“It’s not buzzer-based or timer-based, meaning the workout can be tailored to make sure our clients are well-trained and in correct form.”</p><p>Walking into one of The Yard’s locations, he said, was “like walking into a boutique hotel”.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“It’s a welcoming experience, with the folded towels, the water, the fresh bowl of fruit, the aesthetics,” he said.</p><p>“We’re the first to deliver that.”</p><p><a class=body-link href=#>chloe.whelan@news.com.au</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2S%2FpsDAoqNorJiaerqt0Z1kp52nYq62v9KinGafqaJ6pMHLrWStmZueu6h5zqdkn2xlZLumw9Jmqq2noq58poHFa22cmWWYgHiEwXGdcG1haIOmsJhrnHGZYWmzdoA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
