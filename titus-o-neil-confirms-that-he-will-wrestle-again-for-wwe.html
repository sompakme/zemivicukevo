He recently made a very strange appearance on an episode of Raw to talk about the virtues of the company. Many have wondered about his in-ring future.</p><p>O’Neil has said in the past that he fully <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">plans to return</a> to the squared circle. There has not been a timetable set, but he’s keeping busy with his work in communities all over as a representative of WWE. In March, he revealed that he has been rehabbing a procedure on his knee.</p><p>In a new interview behind Fightful’s pay wall, Titus O’Neil spoke about his future in WWE. The company did confirm that he is not a current member of the active roster. However, Titus believes that when the time is right, he will once again compete in the ring.</p><p>“Titus told FIghtful that he’s not retired, and fully plans to return to the ring one day. A WWE source did confirm he’s not considered to be on their “active roster.” He hasn’t put a time table on a return, but he said that he will discuss it with WWE when he feels the time is right, but it “will happen.” As of now, he’s fully embraced his role as Global Ambassador with WWE.”</p><p>As fans await his arrival, Titus continues to do good work everywhere he goes. He was even honored in 2021 when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a middle school was named for him</a>. While he can’t wrestle right now, he is enjoying his role.</p><p>Titus O’Neil was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame</a> in 2020. He received the Warrior Award for his work behind the scenes and as an ambassador. While he enjoys that job, he does look forward to one day returning to wrestling, where it all began.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What do you think of this story?
