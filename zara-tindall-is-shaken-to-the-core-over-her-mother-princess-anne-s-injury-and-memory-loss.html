This has been a huge wake-up call for everyone in the family, and they’re rightfully distressed.”</p><p>Anne, 73, was reportedly struck by a horse, and is now home from hospital “and expected to make a full recovery,” <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1917302/princess-anne-daughter-zara-tindall-worried-health referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>The Daily Express</u></a> reports, adding that Anne’s husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, said his wife is “recovering slowly” after being discharged from Southmead Hospital. (In addition to her husband being on hand with her at the hospital, Tindall also visited her mother while she was there.) The Princess Royal “is expected to return to public duties when doctors advise that it’s safe to do so,” The Daily Express reports.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GpKw2ZrgVHmba8fD6tMG5V-1920-80.jpg><p>Tindall—who is married to former rugby player Mike Tindall and is a mother of three—is “very close” to her uncle, King Charles, a source speaking to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/zara-tindall-could-royal-role-33146016 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>The Mirror</u></a> said; they added that she “might become more involved in this side of things, and that Charles is keen to support such an interest by bestowing on her the title of princess,” which Anne chose not to do when Zara was born in 1981. (She made the same decision—to not give a royal title—to her son, Peter Phillips, when he was born in 1977; it’s a decision Tindall has praised in the past.) The King, apparently, believes his eldest niece should have been given the title “all along,” they said.</p><p>It’s not clear if the title was offered if Tindall would even accept it—she said recently she was “obviously very lucky that my mother didn’t give us any titles, so I really commend her on that.”</p><p>Columnist Angela Mollard said that Tindall and her cousin, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/prince-william/>Prince William</a>, are the “best of friends,” and said if she were in William’s shoes, it would make sense for the Prince of Wales to start “pulling in” someone as “trusted” and “faithful” as Tindall.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
