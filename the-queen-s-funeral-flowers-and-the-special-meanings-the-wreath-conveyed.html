Queen Elizabeth II served her country for 70 years, the second longest reign of any monarch in history, so these flowers will have been carefully chosen to reflect upon her dutiful service to her country.’</p><p>‘<strong>Scabious</strong>, although a popular wedding flower, also found its place in the Queen's funeral wreath,’ Rachel adds. ‘Although it may seem out of place at first, these flowers represent love and peace.’&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/94oAFRHQysUyqubaknaFak-1920-80.jpg><p><strong>Myrtle</strong> was another traditional wedding flower to be included in the wreath, with the sprigs in the arrangement cut from a plant grown from a sprig of myrtle used in the Queen’s 1947 wedding bouquet, revealed the official <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://twitter.com/RoyalFamily referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Royal Family Twitter account</a>.</p><p>UK gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh spoke to the BBC at the funeral explaining that, ‘[The Queen] was a keener gardener more than most people would realize.’ With the Queen having looked after her own <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-redirect=https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/queen-private-garden-sandringham-estate-215334 data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/gardens/king-charles-private-garden-at-the-sandringham-estate><u>private garden at the Sandringham estate</u></a>, this special cutting, therefore, carries significant personal meaning to the late monarch. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zMxovFcopTaU2HXn6bCFRm-1920-80.jpg><p><strong>English Oak </strong>cuttings were also featured alongside the flowers, representing the strength of love and speaking to the long royal history of England. ‘Our history was in that wreath,’ Alan continued. ‘There were oak leaves in there. There are oak trees in Great Windsor Park that were growing when William the Conqueror invaded in 1066. Some of them are still there.’</p><p>Perhaps the most touching tribute, however, was the addition of a small handwritten card from her son, King Charles III. The note, written on his personal stationery simply read: “In loving and devoted memory, Charles R.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QyLvQ69w5ghzGgYDwYNSbm-1920-80.jpg><p>One interesting flower that appears to be missing from the arrangement is the <strong>Lily of the Valley</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>‘Lily of the Valley was <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/news/queens-favourite-flower-lily-of-the-valley-virtual-chelsea-flower-show-216549><u>the Queen's favorite flower</u></a>,’ Alan Titchmarch added. The smaller, humble flower symbolizes motherhood and humility. The blooms grow in abundance in the gardens of Buckingham Palace and were featured in the Queen's wedding bouquet in 1947 and her Coronation bouquet in 1953. These special flowers held other special associations for the Monarch for many years too, so it is expected that these flowers may have featured heavily in the family's private ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p>The Queen has been laid to rest at <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/house-design/worlds-best-homes/windsor-castle><u>Windsor Castle</u></a>, her most beloved home, in <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.homesandgardens.com/house-design/worlds-best-homes/st-georges-chapel><u>St. Georges Chapel</u></a> beside her late husband Prince Phillip, and her parents. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvMnqqappScrrOwxKeqZ5ufonyvsdasZq2glWK%2BtrHEp6pmnqWjsrOty2adpaenmr%2B0</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
