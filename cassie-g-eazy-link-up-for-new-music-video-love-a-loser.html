Having been relatively quiet since then, Cassie returned to the scene last week with a 10-minute short film called Cassie, which&nbsp;she has now turned into shortened music video for the film's soundtrack "Love A Loser."</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=s1>Directed by Harrison Boyce, the video opens up with Cassie and her on-screen love interest (played by Gazi Ghost) reflecting on his upbringing in the projects of Paris. From there though, the couple go on a wild ride, hitting up the desert motel and showing us the up & downs of their relationships. From making love to constantly fighting, Cassie questions whether or not she should love him or leave<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>him alone. “I would rather lose a lover than to love a loser,” she sings. G-Eazy on the other hand comes in for his respective verse and posts up at the motel to reflect on some past relationships of his own.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=s1>Cassie debuted the video on “TRL” yesterday where she also spoke on the short film. “I wanted to do something different from a regular music video, which I still have,” she said. “But I worked with Harrison Boyce, he directed it, and I really enjoyed being part of it.”</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=s1>The record itself is expected to appear on Cassie’s forthcoming sophomore album,&nbsp;her first since her 2006 debut. No word yet when that'll be arriving, but she did say it was about 70% done in a recent interview with Power106.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span class=s1>Check out the official video (above) and look out for details on her next album to hopefully surface sooner than later, as well as a follow up single for that matter.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Record available now on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">iTunes</a>.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Kevin Goddard is an editor for HNHH.
