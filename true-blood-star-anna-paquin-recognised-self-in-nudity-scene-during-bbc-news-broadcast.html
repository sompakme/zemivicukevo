MY BREASTS!! SO FUNNY ON SO MANY LEVELS." She then retweeted a fan who wrote: "Cool that @AnnaPaquin has a sense of humour about these things," adding: "It's objectively funny!" The scene shown on the News at Ten was between herself and her co-star, Robert Kazinsky, who joined in on the fun. He tweeted Anna: "Thankfully it's a shot of you and not my tombstone tied donut eating belly."</p><p id=ewRzAGR0-vX0 data-wc=10><span><strong>READ:&nbsp;True Blood star Anna Paquin dyes her hair purple</strong></span></p><p id=ePvdV96XC0AX data-wc=80>Anna's husband, Stephen Moyer, who also co-starred in the popular fantasy show, also joined in on the discussion, writing: "This is amazing and making me very happy." Anna replied to him, writing: "Isn't it hilarious babe?" The mum-of-two also had a giggle over the statement released by the BBC, in which they said they were 'looking into the matter'. She wrote: "What's there to look into? My tits photobombed the news because someone was watching #TrueBlood in view of camera."</p><p id=egZl-LOjRzso data-wc=92><strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Anna recently co-starred with Downton Abbey actor </a></strong>Allen Leech in a Canadian drama, Bellevue. Speaking to HELLO! Canada about Anna's performance in the show, he said: "Their relationship is really fragile and tense and it's almost like they need to be away from each other but they can't leave each other. I [also] love that the main character is a woman who doesnâ€™t have it all together. I thought it was such an honest portrayal. Anna is an absolute force in this show and she brings this character to life in such a believable way. She is absolutely brilliant."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQcGdxaWRpfnaDkmirq62VYq%2Btu86dZJqmnpZ6sa3QrqCnZZ6qsarA2GaqnJ2emnqjrsJmpZ6vo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
