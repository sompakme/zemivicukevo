Her personal life has been a bit more complicated.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>She used to date her on-screen boyfriend <a href=#>Andrew Shue</a> back in the early 1990s. She married geneticist Andrew Conrad impulsively in 2000 while on vacation in Hawaii. They divorced seven months later, per <a href=#>People</a>. Then, in 2004, she was set to marry Dr. Robert Andrews and bailed on that within weeks of the wedding, per <a href=#>OK! magazine</a>. Thorne-Smith got her happy ending when she married Roger Fishman, the president of marketing firm Zizo Group, on January 1, 2007. She gave birth to their son, Jacob Emerson Fishman, on January 11, 2008, per <a href=#>People.</a></p><p dir=ltr>More recently, Thorne Smith appeared in the series finale of "Mom," as Sam, the AA sponsor of Adam. "There were so many people on the crew who were on 'Two and a Half Men.' It was crazy fun," she told the&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Post</a>.&nbsp;"Multi-cam sitcoms are my favorite kind of work. You're together with the cast. You only film two days, three days; you're hanging out and chatting. My time on 'Mom' was a reminder of how I lived that life." Thorne-Smith concluded, "Sitcoms are the one job in this business where you can have a good work-life balance."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlobIB3e9ahmK2dppq%2FbrTAqaeeppWZerW7jJymrqqko7K6edOhpqumlWLArrXToWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
