In the latest installment,&nbsp;InStyle&nbsp;spoke to&nbsp;social media star and Lancôme global ambassador&nbsp;Emma Chamberlain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Describe your perfect night out.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With my best friends, obviously! Probably in L.A. or New York. We go to dinner—I don’t care what it is, but it needs to be really yummy. Then, to a wine bar. I need a glass of wine! Then, we’re going to go to not a club, but a bar, but it’s almost a club. But it’s a bar. But there’s dancing. That’s the vibe. I want to be there until it closes at two. And then I want to go to an after-party. This is we’re-going-all-night vibes. And I want the after party to have a lot of really fun people that I don’t know very well so that I can make a new friend. And maybe there’s a cute guy, and maybe I get a number.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>If you could get ready for a night with any famous person, dead or alive, who would it be and why?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Helena Bonham Carter! Getting ready to go out with her would be f**king iconic. She looks amazing, and you know she’s so fun.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image--theme-3 instyle-sc-block-image--large instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image theme-3 mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Carla Guler for Lancôme</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What are your top three getting-ready tracks?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My friends and I love Olivia Rodrigo when we’re getting ready. I’m sorry, but “Bad Idea,” right? When you’re getting ready, it’s such a vibe. It’s so indulgent. It’s so good. But also, I love something upbeat. We love the newest Strokes album. It’s just so good. That whole album is just so upbeat and fun. Obviously, it's “The Adults Are Talking,” and everybody knows the words, but I think it’s “At the Door.” That leads me to my third answer, which is sometimes I like to listen to The Smiths randomly. It’s just dramatic. And you feel like you’re in an ’80s movie, and you’re like, It’s hot. That’s right before you leave.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What’s your process for putting together a look?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s always finding one piece that I know I want to wear. So it’s like, Oh, I need to wear this pair of shoes or this bag, so everything’s going around with that. And then it’s finding things that are the same color, that are the same vibe. I’m all about the sandwiching.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Describe your beauty vibe in three words.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hot girl vibes.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image--theme-3 instyle-sc-block-image--large instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image theme-3 mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Carla Guler for Lancôme</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Do you have any pre-going-out skin-care rituals?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Honestly, my only thing is I just hydrate every day, day and night. So, I am also hydrating right before makeup. I always wash my face right before I do my makeup, too. Some people don’t, but I have to wash and go back and redo the whole skin-care routine. Even if I did it two hours ago, I don’t care. I also like tools, the little micro-current thing.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image--theme-3 instyle-sc-block-image--large instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image theme-3 mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Carla Guler for Lancôme</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br><strong>What’s your pre-going-out makeup routine?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I like super natural skin just because [makeup] ends up coming off anyway, so I don’t want to overdo it. But I’m definitely bronzing it up; it’s a key moment. I’m bronzing up the eye, too! And then a chunky lash, too, kind of. Not too chunky. And a really solid lip combo. I like it to be simple because over the course of the night, you’re sweating, you’re being funny. It doesn’t matter because it wears off nicely.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It starts with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Lancôme Génifique Face Serum</a> because that’s the base for everything. I’ll mix it with foundation, and it creates this gorgeous, dewy, light sort of situation. Then, I will use the classic All Over Concealer. The Star Bronzer powder is so good, and it's also going on the lid; we know this. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Lash Idôle</a> is a classic. There are 10 lip liners, there are 10. Actually, by the way, there’s every lip product I’ve ever owned on my counter. So just imagine that, because the lip is the moment. I’ve taught myself how to re-line my lips without looking. I don’t need a mirror. It’s an unbelievable skill to have. It took me months. And I’m spot on, too. When you see me out one night with my lip all the way over on the side of my face because I actually did not nail it… it’s just...don’t bring it up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What essentials do you tote around in your evening bag?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As long as I have the lip, everything else can be a mess. I always end up packing a cute little mini bag because that’s just what happens. It’s like, I can’t bring a cross-body to the bar. It’s weird. I would love to be able to bring a nice big bag out, but you know how it is; we just want a cute little bag, right? It fits nothing. I always have a wallet and portable charger. That’s the main thing. I travel light.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image--theme-3 instyle-sc-block-image--large instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image theme-3 mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Carla Guler for Lancôme</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What’s your skin-care routine when you get home?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I’m going all in. Okay? Because listen, there are some nights when it’s like, we’re lucky that we’re getting out the micellar water, and we’re doing the bare minimum. But in an ideal world, I’m going all in. So we’re going in with the eye makeup remover. Then we’re going in with the micellar water and the incredible cleansing milk. Then I go in with a full cleanser... That’s the final step. It’s a quadruple cleanse. Then, I do like to chemical exfoliate, so, the Clarifique serum. My skin gets really dry after a night out. Génifique serum, Génifique night cream, Génifique eye cream. And if I’m really dry, the Absolue Oil, a thin layer of the oil, and we’re done. But, really, it’s all about quad cleansing!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xKakmmWTna6ursSro5qhnmKvpq3UrbBmqp%2Bqwaq6xGaeqKGenHqwwdNmb25taWx%2Fdw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
