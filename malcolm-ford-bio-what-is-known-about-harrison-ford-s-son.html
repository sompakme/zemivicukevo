He has also built his own identity as a vocalist and musician since he began the band The Dough Rollers in 2008. There is so much about the musician beyond his being Harrison Ford's son, and it's all here.</p><h2>Profile summary</h2><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Malcolm Ford</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> October 3, 1987</li><li><strong>Place of birth:</strong> Wyoming, USA</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 33 (as of May 2021)</li><li><strong>Nationality: </strong>American</li><li><strong>Height:</strong> 6 ft 4 in (193 cm)</li></ul><h2>Malcolm Ford biography</h2><p class=align-left>The musician <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was born on </a>October 3, 1987.

Melissa was Harrison's second wife. Malcolm's parents separated in 2001, an event that was so stressful to the young man that he ended up using drugs. He was only about seventeen then.</p><p class=align-left>Thankfully, he got the help he needed, and he successfully recovered from being an addict. The intervention was in the form of going to a rehabilitation facility and taking part in family therapy during his time at the facility. Being at the rehab turned out to be a blessing in disguise as he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uncovered his passion</a> for <a href=#>music</a> along his path of recovery from addiction.</p><p class=align-left>Sadly, Malcolm's mum succumbed to neuroendocrine cancer on November 4, 2015.</p><h3>Harrison Ford children</h3><p class=align-left>Malcolm has four siblings; two half-brothers, a younger sister, and an adoptive brother. His two half-brothers, Ben and Willard, are from his dad's first marriage. Ben was born in 1966, while Willard was born in 1969. Malcolm's younger sister is named Georgia, born to Harrison and Melissa in 1990.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/30536c76724eec54.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Travis Bacon biography: what is known about Kevin Bacon’s son?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Liam Flockhart became a part of the Harrison Ford family when his adoptive mum, actress Calista Flockhart, married Harrison in 2010. Calista had adopted Liam, who was born in 2001, before her marriage to the movie star.</p><p class=align-left>Despite being born to a celebrity dad, Harrison Ford kids had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a pretty normal life</a> growing up, as their dad was good at keeping his family and personal life away from the public light.</p><h3>Education</h3><p class=align-left>Malcolm went to a school in Jackson Hole in the US state of Wyoming. He has not shared the specific details of where he went to school or his academic qualifications. What is known, however, is that he dropped out of college at some point.</p><h3>Music career</h3><p class=align-left>Ford began his career in the music industry when he started the band The Dough Rollers in 2008. He created the band alongside a friend of his named Jack Byrne.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4880a3778b657987.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The fascinating story of John Krasinski: what is "The Office" star up to?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The story of how the two became friends is quite fascinating, as they bonded over using controlled substances, and they were also drawn to the same kind of music, which is the blues music genre.</p><p class=align-left>The duo was joined by singer Julia Tapper, a much-needed part of the group at the time, as she got the band to explore other music genres apart from what they had been doing. The band released its first album named <i>Dough Rollers</i> in 2010, which had ten tracks made up of music from various genres.</p><p class=align-left>The band released its second album titled <i>Someday Baby</i> in 2011. In 2014, they released their first EP, which they named <i>Gone Baby Gone</i>. They have hired other musicians to join them over the years. Malcolm is a guitar player and singer in the band.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, the band has been very quiet lately. The most recent music from them was released back in 2016, they have not been active on their social media since 2015, and their website does not exist anymore. Thus, it is hard to know what The Dough Rollers are up to now.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f22d343a4a469b79.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Michael Richards bio: Most exciting details about Cosmo Kramer from Seinfeld</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In addition to his music career, Malcolm also has a film credit to his name. He starred in <i>Water to Wine</i>, a short film where he appeared as a snowboarding guru.</p><h3>Malcolm Ford net worth</h3><p class=align-left>The musician's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> is estimated at $1 million. This could be attributed to his music career and achievements.</p><h3>Personal life</h3><p class=align-left>Malcolm briefly dated Jessica Stam in 2008. Stam is a model, and at the time she was listed by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Forbes Magazine</a> as one of the World's 15 Top-Earning Supermodels in 2007. Being linked to such a star earned Malcolm the public spotlight.</p><p class=align-left>The relationship did not last long as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">they broke up</a> after a few months of dating. Harrison Ford son probably decided to keep his personal life private as he has not shared any information regarding his relationships since then.</p><p class=align-left>After Malcolm's band has ceased activity on their social media, it is hard to tell what the musician is doing these days. He does not have any pages of his own, nor is he known to be linked to people with social media presence. In any case, hopefully we haven't seen (and heard) the last of him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c899ee998fd885f0.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jonathan Gilbert bio: Age, siblings, net worth, where is he now?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>Raina Huang biography: age, ethnicity, boyfriend, competitive eating</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Legit.ng</a> recently published an article on the biography <a href=#>Raina Huang</a>.
