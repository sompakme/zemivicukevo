The first season ended with a cliffhanger that left many questions unanswered. Will Sunny and Firoz escape from the police? Will Michael succeed in his plan to destroy Mansoor? Will Megha find out the truth about Sunny? Will Sunny and Megha‚Äôs relationship survive the betrayal?</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no official confirmation from Amazon Prime Video or D2R Films about the renewal or cancellation of the series. However, given the popularity and success of the series, there is a high possibility that it will be renewed for a second season. The series has a loyal fan base that is demanding more episodes on social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram.</p><p>Moreover, the cast and crew of the series have also expressed their interest and enthusiasm for continuing the story. In an interview with The Times of India, Shahid Kapoor said that he had a great experience working on the series and that he would love to do more seasons of Farzi. He also said that he was amazed by the response and feedback from the audience.</p><p>Similarly, Vijay Sethupathi said that he enjoyed playing Michael in the series and that he was looking forward to working with Raj & DK again.

The first season took about eight months to complete from pre-production to post-production. Therefore, we can estimate that the second season will follow a similar timeline.</p><p>However, this is just a speculation based on the previous pattern of the series. There could be many factors that could affect the production and release date of the second season, such as the availability of the cast and crew, the budget and logistics, the script and editing process, and the COVID-19 pandemic situation.</p><p>Therefore, we advise you to take this prediction with a pinch of salt and wait for an official announcement from Amazon Prime Video or D2R Films regarding the renewal and release date of Farzi season 2.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_can_we_expect_from_season_2_of_Farzi></span>What can we expect from season 2 of Farzi?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The first season of Farzi introduced us to a thrilling world of crime, deception, and action.
