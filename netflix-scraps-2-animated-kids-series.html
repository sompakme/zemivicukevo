Sources told The Hollywood Reporter that creative impasses on each show led to the decision to scrap them.</p><p>Dino Daycare, created by Jeff King, was announced in 2020 as part of the <a href=#>first slate of animated shows</a> that Nee (Doc McStuffins) was overseeing for Netflix. The show was to take place in a world where dinosaurs never went extinct and a 6-year-old boy helps out at a nursery for baby dinos of all shapes and sizes.</p><p>“Hard day for a beautiful show deep into production,” Nee <a href=# rel=nofollow>tweeted</a>. “So much love to Jeff King and the incredible Dino Daycare crew. I have no doubt it will find a new home. But right now, hard.”</p><p>Another of the shows from Nee, Ridley Jones, debuted on Netflix in 2021, and the third, Spirit Rangers, is slated to premiere later this year. Nee has also collaborated with Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground Productions on Ada Twist and the School House Rock-esque We the People.</p><p>Boons and Curses was created by Jaydeep Hasrajani (the 2016 Powerpuff Girls) and initially set for a 2023 premiere. The story centers on a young warrior — who thanks to a curse is now made of butter — who takes on an evil ruler. The show was announced as part of a set of titles featuring Asian American creators and protagonists.</p><p>The shutdown of the two shows comes at the end of a week when Netflix suffered its first net subscriber loss in more than a decade. The company also <a href=#>laid off</a> about 25 people across its marketing operation this week, and on Friday canceled its comedy <a href=#>Space Force</a> after two seasons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOp5ytnpyexW6%2FwquYqatdZ3qstcOsZJqmmaKutbHDZqqeqpmawG59kWxsamtoan15ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
