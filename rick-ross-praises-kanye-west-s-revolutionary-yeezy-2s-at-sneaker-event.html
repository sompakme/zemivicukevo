Whether it's expensive collabs, sought-after restocks and sold-out scalps, or just expensive things in general, he has a lot of pull in the game. But the Chicago artist isn't just commercially successful in these regards, but also very influential. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rick Ross</a> recently commented on his <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Nike</a> Air <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Yeezy</a> 2 sneaker, specifically holding up his legendary Red Octobers at an event. As a sneakerhead himself, he remarked on how this design and style changed the game.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"This s**t right here was revolutionary," Rick Ross said of Kanye West's Nike Air Yeezy 2 sneakers. "Yeah, this was... it was revolutionary. But you know, these joints, the grey ones? I wanna say with the mauve, the pink, whatever. Yeah, yeah, you know, they was just... I had them, I wore them every day. On some just, you know, you realize how genius the artwork was after the fact." Now that there are <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">restocks of old Yeezy products</a>, there's a lot of conversation around the brand and Ye's many fashion ventures.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-yeezy-2s-get-rick-ross-seal-of-revolutionary-status-watch>Yeezy 2s Get Rick Ross' Seal Of "Revolutionary" Status: Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, the two "Devil In A New Dress" collaborators have a strong relationship together, and one that almost became even closer recently. Of course, a big debate right now is how much Kanye West we should be celebrating amid <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his antisemitic and far right ties</a>. This caused the distribution of his collab album with Ty Dolla $ign, Vultures, to become very difficult to secure. Then, Rick Ross actually reflected on whether the duo could reach out to his <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Maybach Music Group</a> for distribution, and while it clearly didn't manifest, it would've been interesting to see one rapper support another.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Imagine if Ye came and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">allowed MMG to distribute his new project</a>," he remarked on his Instagram Story back in October. "Imagine that. What’s your favorite Rick Ross, Ye collab? Imagine that. Imagine the artistic drive. And I got some amazing ideas for the&nbsp;Yeezy&nbsp;brand. Amazing ideas for the Yeezy brand! Let’s speak."
