Despite his beef with Eminem, the song doesn't include any direct shots at the rapper, although he does <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">take aim at Jack Harlow</a>. Harlow had recently claimed to be the “hardest white boy” since Eminem on his “They Don’t Love It” track. Harlow released the song on his latest album, Jackman, which he dropped last month.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">MGK shared his new freestyle on Instagram. "Never been afraid to say what’s on my mind at any given time of day. New cypher out now," he captioned the post. He also introduced the song by explaining that he was recording it in a friend's backyard.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-machine-gun-kelly-disses-jack-harlow-on-renegade-freestyle>Machine Gun Kelly Disses <a href=# class=text-word>Jack Harlow</a> On "Renegade Freestyle"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for the Harlow diss, Kelly raps, “I’m a Great White / I could eat these Barracudas / I see why they call you Jackman / You jacked man’s whole swag / Give Drake his flow back, man.” It's unclear why Kelly has decided to diss Harlow, as TMZ describes the two as being friends. Back in 2020, Kelly even appeared on a remix to Harlow's "What's Poppin."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Kelly's relationship with Eminem</a>, the two have had beef for many years. The animosity stems from a tweet Kelly posted about Eminem’s daughter, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Hailie Mathers</a>, back in 2012. Kelly later dissed him on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tech N9ne</a>’s 2018 song “No Reason.” In response, Eminem took aim at him on his Kamikaze song, "Not Alike." He rapped, "He wants to keep up his tough demeanour / So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na (Yeah) / But next time you don’t gotta use Tech N9ne / If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun / And I’m talkin’ to you But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly / I don’t use sublim’s and sure as fuck don’t sneak-diss / But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie I keep on telling motherfuckers / But, just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories jarred / like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly / I respond rarely, but this time Shady ’bout to sound off."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong><span>Quotable Lyrics:</span></strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The truth is my closest tried to cross me like Judas<br>But can't cross me like I'm Jewish<br>The Crosshair's a little shakey, they missed me by two inch</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
