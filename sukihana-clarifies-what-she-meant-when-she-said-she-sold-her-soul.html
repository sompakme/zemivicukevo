Her and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sexyy Red</a> are at the top of this lane right now, and fans have grown acustom to their outlandish lyrics. Sure, she might be polarizing, but if you want to be successful in 2024, that's kind of the cheat code. Having said that, it hasn't always been easy for Suki.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In a video posted to her social media in 2019, the artist was ready to quit music altogether. In fact, she came out and said that she had signed a horrible record deal and that she had ultimately sold her soul. Selling ones soul is a concept that has existed forever, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">and there is debate around what it actually means</a>. Well, in an interview with Math Hoffa on My Expert Opinion, Suki got to clarify her statement. Essentially, she just meant that she was in a bad deal that didn't give her ownership over her own work.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sukihana-speaks-to-math-hoffa>Sukihana Speaks To Math Hoffa</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I was in a street, hood contract,” she explained. “I was in a bad contract. That’s what I meant, but people take it out of proportion. I feel like if you do sign a contract and you don’t own a lot of your stuff, I feel like that’s selling out, that’s selling your sold.” Suki then went on to say that she is no longer in this deal. Instead, she is doing well for herself, and is excited to move forward with her current career. It's always good to see an artist win, and we hope Suki is able to have continued success.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of these comments, down below.
