Take the words of Freddie Steward after <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>England’s excellent defensive performance</a> in their opening game of the tournament against Argentina, after revealing that England’s players had copped “a bit of a rocket” from Sinfield following the warm-up defeat to Fiji at Twickenham.</p><p>“That’s what makes Kev such a good defence coach, he’s so inspiring,” Steward said. “He motivates us so much and he’s the sort of bloke you don’t want to let down. That’s testament to him as a bloke. When you go out there, part of it is you do it for him. You don’t want to see a guy like that who puts his heart and soul into us in his work with his defence feel let down.”</p><p>England this year, as you may have sensed with some wildly fluctuating results and performances, have been trying to get through several years’ work in a hurry, a situation necessitated by the Rugby Football Union’s call to pull the plug on Eddie Jones last December. Those growing pains have been clear with their fitness and attacking progress, and certainly as well with their defence.</p><p>Compare England’s defensive statistics for the whole of 2023 with how they fared under defence coach Anthony Seibold in the autumn Tests last year – against Argentina, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa – and the results are unfavourable, conceding an extra try and two more line breaks per game this year under Sinfield.</p><p>Break those statistics up however into chunks for the Six Nations, warm-up matches and Rugby World Cup, with the latter of course being the ultimate goal, and an upward curve becomes obvious. England’s points conceded dropped from 27 in the Six Nations to 13.2 in France, their tries conceded from 3.6 to 1.2. The defensive figures at the Rugby World Cup are even better in some categories than last autumn, including points and tries conceded, tackle success percentage, opposition 22m entries and gain-line success. The World Cup match against Chile has to be taken into account, of course, but so do England’s improvements.</p><p>Why is now therefore the time where Sinfield and England <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>are increasingly expected to part ways</a>? Telegraph Sport understands there are a couple of factors.</p><p>Sinfield’s inspirational qualities as noted previously are undeniable, but there were also suggestions that while his defensive messages were always clear, they could be light on technical detail. That is partly linked to the fact that despite Sinfield’s illustrious playing career in rugby league winning seven Grand Finals and two Challenge Cups with Leeds, he joined Leicester in 2021 under Borthwick with limited coaching experience, particularly in rugby union.</p><p>When appointed by England at the start of the year Sinfield admitted that it was Burrow’s journey which had inspired him to take some risks. “I felt it was important I kept taking on challenges. To realise you’re not here for a long time, and to make the most out of it, and the most out of life,” Sinfield said.&nbsp;</p><p>Having previously “never wanted to coach” until he approached that crossroads after three years in an administrative role with Leeds, he was soon at Leicester with Borthwick and winning the Gallagher Premiership title last June, then trying to fix the wreck which was England’s damaged team with only a year to go until the Rugby World Cup. Which meant that both with Leicester and England, Sinfield has been learning as he went along.</p><p>Another factor mentioned to Telegraph Sport worth considering are the long spells Sinfield has spent away from his home in Oldham, where his family live. Travelling to Leicester regularly was one thing, with the long spells with England either at Pennyhill Park or in camps preparing for the Rugby World Cup, as well as the tournament itself, making for a stark change from Sinfield’s previous role before coaching.</p><p>Perhaps this is why all of the noise surrounding Sinfield’s future seems to suggest that any decision to part ways will be mutual.</p><p>When Borthwick confirmed Sinfield’s arrival as defence coach towards the end of last year, he noted how the best teams work hard for each other, cover for each other, “celebrate with each other and lift each other up when they get knocked down”. Borthwick then said: “If there’s a person that embodies that ethos, it’s Kevin Sinfield. He’s the type of person you want in your environment. Kevin is a top-quality coach, incredible coach – but I think he’s an even better human being.” Even if this is the end for Sinfield with England, those words remain true.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKqlnK%2B6edSnoKimX2d9c3%2BOamdoamRkwKq6xaKcpZxdmruouMCnm2adqJ7BbsPOq6OdZZOqvW7AxJyfp6GTlrlut82orqWdlJyybrPAqWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
