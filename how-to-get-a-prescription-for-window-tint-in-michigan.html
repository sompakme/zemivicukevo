Not If You've Got the Doctor's Note: How to Get a Prescription for Window Tint in Michigan</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:150><span>Living in Michigan,</span><span> the "Great Lakes State,</span><span>" is pretty awesome.</span><span> Except for,</span><span> you know,</span><span> that whole </span><strong>endless winter</strong><span> thing and the summer sun that can turn your car into a rolling sauna.</span><span> Window tint is a lifesaver,</span><span> but here in the Mitten State,</span><span> the laws are a bit...</span><span>well...</span><span>shady.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:131><span>Fear not,</span><span> fellow sun-baked citizens!</span><span> There is a way to cruise in comfort,</span><span> even if your sunglasses look permanently attached to your face.</span><span> Today,</span><span> we're diving into the world of </span><strong>medical exemptions for window tint</strong><span> in Michigan.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=7:1-7:54>Step 1: Channel Your Inner Doctor (But Not Really)</h3><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:318><span>Alright,</span><span> so you can't exactly write yourself a prescription for window tint (although that would be super convenient).</span><span> What you actually need is a </span><strong>statement from a licensed physician or optometrist</strong><span>.</span><span> This document basically says,</span><span> "Hey,</span><span> this person needs extra protection from the sun because [insert medical reason here].</span><span>"</span></p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:287><strong>Here's the thing:</strong><span> Not just any sunburn will qualify.</span><span> We're talking about conditions like lupus,</span><span> certain skin sensitivities,</span><span> or even recovering from eye surgery.</span><span> Basically,</span><span> if the sun is your arch nemesis,</span><span> there's a good chance a medical professional can be your window tint wingman.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=13:1-13:78>Step 2: Paperwork Palooza (But It's Worth It for Cruising in Cool Comfort)</h3><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:368><span>Now comes the not-so-thrilling part:</span><span> </span><strong>filling out the application</strong><span>.</span><span> Head over to the Michigan Secretary of State's website (don't worry,</span><span> it's not as scary as it sounds) and download the </span><strong>Medical Exception Certificate (form TR-67A)</strong><span>.</span><span> This is where you'll channel your inner legal eagle (or find a friend who is) and make sure everything is filled out correctly.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:152><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong><span> Don't be a typo-tornado!</span><span> Double-check everything before hitting submit.</span><span> A tiny mistake could delay your path to blissful,</span><span> tinted nirvana.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=19:1-19:61>Step 3: The Waiting Game (But Hopefully Not for Too Long)</h3><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:278><span>Once you've submitted your application and the </span><strong>medical statement</strong><span> from your doctor,</span><span> it's time to play the waiting game.</span><span> The Michigan Department of State will review everything,</span><span> and hopefully,</span><span> you'll get the green light to tint your windows beyond the usual legal limits.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:226><strong>Fun Fact:</strong><span> While you wait,</span><span> try wearing a wide-brimmed hat and blasting air conditioning.</span><span> It won't be quite the same as tinted windows,</span><span> but it'll help you channel your inner beach bum until your application is approved.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=25:1-25:67>FAQ: Frequently Asked
