But fear not, fellow mitten-state margardener! July is prime time to get a second act going in your vegetable patch. Here's how to keep the harvest rolling and avoid a sunflower monoculture (unless that's your artistic vision, no judgment here).</p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:21><strong>Beantastic Beans:</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:468>Let's face it, beans are the ultimate "beantastic" (sorry, not sorry) choice for a mid-summer planting. Green beans, shelling beans, or even edamame – they all thrive in the warm weather and fix nitrogen in the soil, basically turning them into <span class="citation-0 citation-end-0">tiny green superheroes for your garden. Just be sure to pick bush varieties – they don't take up as much space as their vining cousins,</span> giving your sunflowers some breathing room (or should we say, headroom?).</p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:26><strong>The Cool Kids of July:</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:406>While most things are sizzling in July, there's a secret society of vegetables that actually crave cooler weather. Brassicas like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage are these cool cats. You won't be harvesting them right away, but getting them started now means you'll have a head start come fall. Plus, there's a certain satisfaction in knowing you're outsmarting Mother Nature, even in a small way.</p><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:31><strong>Planting for the Long Haul:</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:311>July is also the time to think about extending your harvest season into fall. Beets, sweet corn, and some bean varieties can be planted now for a delicious autumn bounty. Just remember, these guys are in it for the long haul, so make sure they have enough space to grow and proper watering during the hot days.</p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:40><strong>Bonus Tip: Don't Forget the Flowers!</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:341>While vegetables are all well and good, flowers are the life of the party (or the garden, in this case). Zinnias, cosmos, and marigolds are all great choices for July planting and will add a burst of color to your garden all the way through fall. Plus, they'll attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, which is a win-win for everyone.</p><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:9><strong>FAQs:</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:46><strong>How to plant seeds directly in the garden?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=25:1-25:141>Make sure the soil is warm and weed-free.
