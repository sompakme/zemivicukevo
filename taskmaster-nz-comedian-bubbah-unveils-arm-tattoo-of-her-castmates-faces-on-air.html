Sieni Leo’o Olo’s forearm.</p><p>But the question on all of our lips was: was it real?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/RppPtjZfapLbJP4Uyqv-u68k7ak=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/ULRNAHLNFJCG5DM6TFKANMPFNE.png"><p>The challenge, as set by Taskmaster Jeremy Wells, was to bring the most unbelievable thing to the table.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>The brief was broad and the comedians brought a range of items to the challenge: a certificate claiming Ray could do a backflip; a VHS; Karen’s confession that she would turn straight for either John Campbell or Jeremy Wells (circa Newsboy, not now); a <i>Ripley’s Believe It Or Not</i> book (with edits).</p><p>But Bubbah - also known as the iconic Tina from Turners - well and truly took the cake.</p><p>“When you look at Ray, Mel, Karen, Dai and I, we’re not a group of friends that you would see at an arcade or just hanging out, it’s a very random group. Will our friendship last?” she queried.</p><p>“I’ve decided for us. You wouldn’t believe this,” she continued, before an image of her tattoo was shown on screen and she bared her forearm to prove it.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/2Cg3dphdTdCky9gl4i-Td-Pm5j4=/16x9/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/LNB6TY2RTBC6PBVAYH2F6BQLI4.png"><p>Of course, Bubbah claimed the win and five points as her prize.</p><p>And speaking to the <i>Herald</i> today, she reveals the tattoo could have turned out quite differently.</p><p>“When I got the challenge, it was the most unbelievable thing - and I really wanted to get in contact with Jason Momoa,” she shares.</p><p>“I really wanted to get something Samoan, or a sheep, tattooed on our a****s,” she laughs.</p><p>“I chased him down. I was so close, because New Zealand’s so two degrees of connection. And I got so close and then I think he was out of town or something. But I didn’t get to him, I was so close to him.</p><p>“So a few days before, I messaged production like, ‘Can you pay for this tattoo?’”</p><p>Unbelievable as the tattoo itself was, it’s perhaps more unbelievable that she missed Momoa - who has been popping up all over New Zealand in recent months, from <a href=#>a hot tub in Queenstown</a> to <a href=#>the top of the Sky Tower</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/f3y_zV03AAZ5BN2zvplw1eIKKy0=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/NUDLUG4WUZE4ZKFMNN24J55MYA.JPG"><p>It was a bold move to make so early in the game - has it upped the stakes for her fellow comedians?</p><p>“I think so, but I have a feeling that that was my best ride, so I might have shot myself in the foot,” she jokes.</p><p>“And I got it on the day that we were shooting. So after that, don’t expect much, guys.”</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>But even after the cameras stopped rolling, her castmates couldn’t believe it.</p><p>“Karen still did not believe that it was real until the end... she thought it was fake, that it was like a sticker of some sort,” she shares.</p><p>“I think they were all just shocked at first and I think it became something that everyone loved.</p><p>“My family were just like, ‘you’re stupid, you will regret it’!”</p><p>But while there are no regrets, she admits that it’s hard to have tattoos as an actor - “so maybe I should train myself to cover up my own tattoos.”</p><p>So, if a new Turner’s ad comes out in the near future, you probably won’t spot the Taskmaster cast in tattoo form.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p><i><b>Taskmaster NZ screens on Monday and Tuesday nights on TVNZ2 from 7.30pm</b></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBor%2FKppisrJWneq%2FGjJympp2Unq6vecGumZuZmGLCr8LEoqOsZZGnum7AwK2rqKddpLNutMSrZJyZo6m6osDErGSfmZOawG67zWaYoqpfeZx2mZGGe255enyYkZSpioxrj4CBmZidopJm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
