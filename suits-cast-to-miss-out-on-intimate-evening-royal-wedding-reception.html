Rick admitted he found out about Meghan and Harry's relationship early on, and couldn't help but get protective over his friend. "I had gotten the news early and I was like, you've got to be kidding me," he said. "It was like both of us in the trailer, just kind of like 'you're dating a prince?'…and then I was just like take it slow, be careful, don't let him hurt you."</p><p id=eDINZzrOssua data-wc=83>Meanwhile, Gina said she knew "very little actually" about Meghan's romance before it was revealed to the world in October 2016. "I mean we knew she was excited and there was reason to keep it close to the vest," she said, adding of the moment she received her invitation to the wedding: "I was [shocked]…I hope nothing but, as we all do, the best for her. This is an incredible step in her life and so to bear witness to that is extraordinary."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/28888d4998c9-meghan-markle-suits-friends-z.jpg><p id=eYzNYB8Op5Rd><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: Meghan Markle's on-screen husband arrives in the UK for the royal wedding</a></p><p id=e1VeNgBl198O data-wc=67>Meghan worked on for seven years, and the cast became so close they actually consider each other more as "family" than simply colleagues. "We called ourselves the sister wives…we were with each other for longer than we went to college or high school with our friends so we became family, we’re still family so this is a wonderful family affair," Sarah, who plays Donna Paulson, said.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
