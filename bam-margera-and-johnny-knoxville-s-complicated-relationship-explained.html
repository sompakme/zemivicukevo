Director and co-creator Jeff Tremaine had worked with Knoxville performing stunts and the two began to dream up a hit formula. Around this same time, Margera from West Chester, Pennsylvania was growing an impressive following thanks to his "CKY" videos of stunts and hijinks. "I remember when Jeff first called me. He flew me out to L.A., and I played CKY2K for him and Johnny. They just loved it. They were like, 'You'd be perfect for 'Jackass,'" Margera told <a href=#>Maxim</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>After turning down an offer to regularly perform stunts on "Saturday Night Live," the guys went with MTV and "Jackass" was born. The crew moved on from TV to movies, bringing the laughs to the big screen with multiple feature films. Outside of filming, Steve-O was banned from MTV studios for substance abuse. "He was on this path of pure destruction," Margera recalled. Fortunately, Steve-O recovered but Margera was dealing with his own issues with alcohol abuse while coping with the <a href=#>tragic death of friend and "Jackass" member Ryan Dunn</a>, in part.&nbsp;"I was s**tbag wasted every night, and eventually was like, 'This has to stop,'" Margera admitted to&nbsp;<a href=#>People</a>.</p><p>After starting work together on "Jackass 4," Margera claimed that Knoxville forced him into rehab. After leaving the program, Margera criticized "Dr. Knoxville" for allegedly forbidding him to not take two prescribed drugs, <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlkZ353gI6bmKZlnZa%2FqLHRmmSappRit7C0zaewZqOepMW3tculnKxlk6S6sbjInJitnZRiv6a4wK2gqKajnbaxecSxp6WZmaOypXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
