He recently admitted that he would not be reprising his role in <a href=#>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a>, based on schedule conflicts for his new movie. That new movie happens to be a starring role in the new Jordan Peele thriller, Nope. However, with similar genre-based films the actor has been involved in, he is wanting to branch out a bit more. He is going to do so by making a dark live-action version of Barney. Yes, you read that right. You can see a quote from the actor about the film below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Daniel Kaluuya confirms his live-action <a href=#>#Barney</a> movie is happening</p><p>It will be darker than the TV show</p><p>Previously he said, "Barney taught us, ‚ÄòI love you, you love me, won't you say you love me too?' That‚Äôs one of the first songs I remember‚Ä¶ what happens when that isnt true?" <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/28x9HM3dVP</a></p>‚Äî Culture Crave üçø (@CultureCrave) <a href=#>July 14, 2022</a></figure><p>Although the above quote is a bit older, David Kaluuya confirmed to <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter </a>that is still working on the film. He has his own production company called 59%, which is slated to produce many projects, one being this live-action Barney film. Kaluuya. Per the THR interview, ‚ÄúHe confirmed that the project [Barney] is still in early development and the script is being reworked.‚Äù The interviewer also spoke about how crazy the idea for the film is, which we could all argue sounds odd already. When Kaluuya had been asked why he would chase such an odd concept, the actor said, ‚ÄúMy last number of films have been so aligned to kind of what I stand for as a man,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut there are a whole lot of things that I do as a man. I love kids‚Äô films. How did everyone get into films? Watching kids‚Äô films. I don‚Äôt want to restrict myself to the limitations of what I‚Äôm perceived as.‚Äù</p><p>Being an actor and a creator likely leads to some wild ideas that never quite get produced. However, it sounds as if Daniel Kaluuya does not want to be placed in a box from which he cannot escape from. Separating yourself from the pack is often hard to do but making a dark Barney film will certainly help that issue. In fact, no one would be crazy enough to try it. Well, for some reason we could see Nicolas Cage in this film. He has done some off-the-wall types of films, a Barney sounds like something Cage would do.</p><p>Daniel Kaluuya has now been a collaborator with Jordan Peele on a couple of occasions, and that could have been massively inspirational to the man. He starred in <a href=#>Get Out</a>, and he is set to star in Nope, which comes out next week. Peele might have taught Kaluuya a bit about the horror and thriller genre, and that could have led to the idea of his dark Barney film. We are not saying that is what direction Kaluuya will take the movie, but the above Twitter quote sounds like we are going to be looking at a much darker version of the purple dinosaur.</p><p>It sounds like Daniel Kaluuya is going to be busy with 59% Productions, and we might have to wait a bit to see this new Barney reimagining. He did state that the script is being reworked, so it might take some time before further updates are revealed. For now, we can be patient and see what happens with the film. The idea might be so wild that studios will jump at the chance to make it happen while working with Kaluuya‚Äôs production company. Also, everyone can see Kaluuya in <a href=#>Nope</a>, which is set to debut in theatres on July 22nd.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ickaO2priMpJilraWurm6uwKulnrFdory3tcRnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
