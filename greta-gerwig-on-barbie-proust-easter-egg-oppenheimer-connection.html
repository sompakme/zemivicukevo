Will Ferrell’s Mattel CEO character then proceeds to say, “Remember Proust Barbie? That did&nbsp;not&nbsp;sell well.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But what Gerwig didn’t know is that this weekend’s competing film also has a connection to Proust. Nolan’s film is based on American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb, and Oppenheimer, the man himself, reportedly had an <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/haakon-chevaliers-interview-part-2/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">appreciation for the author</a> as well.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When Gerwig learned of the connection, she responded, “So he would have loved Proust Barbie!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The highly anticipated film follows Robbie’s Barbie and Ryan Gosling’s Ken, who seem to be living this colorful and perfect life in Barbie Land. But when Barbie gets the chance to go to the real human world, she goes on a journey to understand herself and discover her true&nbsp;purpose.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Earlier in the interview, Gerwig also shared if she reads movie reviews once they come out and what her thoughts were after seeing some of the ones for Barbie.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Of course. I’m not Emily Dickinson. I’m not above anything,” she said, noting that she did wait the following day to read them because she was too nervous to look on Wednesday. “There’s a lot of reviewers that I really respect and have really liked. Film criticism matters to me as a person and also being in conversation with people who think about cinema matters. But it can feel very scary at the moment that you’re at the emotional pitch of releasing a movie to take it in.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Gerwig added that she also likes to look back at the reviews a few weeks later so she “can take it in more.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It’s too overwhelming at the moment,” the director said. “But I did check the email and I’m pleased. [Barbie] seems to have been received in the spirit that it was meant, which is exciting.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Barbie debuts in theaters Friday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKi%2BxK2YZp%2BVp8Sqs4ybmKuamZp6sb7OrqqtZZWWwLWx0WacoJ9dpL2xsc2hnKKllad6cn6SbmxtaGdqfXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
