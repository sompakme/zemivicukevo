Between the two milestones, he discovered a passion for makeup artistry, built a portfolio assisting makeup artists on editorial and celebrity work, rose through the ranks, found fame as the man behind Kim Kardashian’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sculpted look</a>, launched his globally renowned MasterClass, and garnered a devoted fan base in the millions. All that time, he had a clear plan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“For the past 20 years of my career, it was always a dream to create my own line,” Dedivanovic shares. “I always felt there was room in the market for an artistry brand with tried-and-true techniques and a strong pillar of education — that was always my vision.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And he achieved that vision. Makeup by Mario is a true artistry brand — it shows in the tiny details, the thoughtful touches, and ground-breaking innovation baked into each product he launches. His products are purposeful, his formulations smart, and his approach unmatched. Dedivanovic and his brand are both staples in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the modern day makeup landscape</a>, and if you haven’t tried anything from the line you’re truly missing out. Whether you’re a Mario loyalist or new to the brand, read on for the nine best Makeup by Mario products.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-universal-makeup-by-mario-master-mattes-eyeshadow-palette></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Universal</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Makeup by Mario Master Mattes Eyeshadow Palette</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Makeup by Mario Master Mattes Eyeshadow Palette" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/LtCSkQNYYye8gAY9DWWEuYkYYhU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Makeup-by-Mario-Master-Mattes-Eyeshadow-Palette-56176dcbba9c4ebb8465330c15e056af.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Inspired by real skin tones the brand tested on, Mario’s Master Mattes Palette is nothing short of a true masterpiece. With 12 shades spanning every neutral tone you could possibly need for an eye look, it really is a staple in any makeup collection. The brilliance, it seems, is in the simplicity — makeup approach aside, there’s just no denying <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the palette’s impressive versatility</a>. And the magic isn’t limited to shade range alone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dedivanovic completely reimagined the traditional matte shadow formula, delivering creamier, sheerer coverage that’s ultra-blendable and buildable, with superior grip that minimizes fallout and makes for long-lasting wear. The attention to detail doesn’t stop there, though: The darkest shade contains carbon black pigment, making it a whopping five times more intense than traditional black shadows. At around $50, it easily exceeds its price in both quality and cost per use. Every detail of this palette — from the flesh-toned shades to the thoughtful formulation — is a testament to Dedivanovic’s artistry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The one downside is you may have a tough time actually purchasing the product. Due to its popularity, it sells out often, so if you see that it's in stock be sure to grab it while you can.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>12 x 0.3 oz powders | <strong>Shades:</strong> 12<strong> | Key Feature:</strong> Easily buildable</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lip-product-makeup-by-mario-moistureglow-plumping-lip-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lip Product</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Makeup by Mario Plumping Lip Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Makeup by Mario MoistureGlow Plumping Lip Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NKQZ0SYC1UI_UzgUnq76-XhCgAg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Makeup-by-Mario-MoistureGlow-Plumping-Lip-Serum-7b6bd500689a43dea3477ad7bf5e5051.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lipstick has never done it for me — I don’t have anything against it per say, I’ve just always gravitated towards sheerer color payoff, deeper hydration, and a glossier finish. If that sounds like your cup of tea, go ahead and stock up on the MoistureGlow Lip Serum.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yet another Dedivanovic innovation, it’s equal parts balm, gloss, tint, serum, and plumper. The elusive your-lips-but-better formula was an instant hit — it sold out within 24 hours of launching (and quickly garnered a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>14,000-plus person waitlist</a>). And with a variety of 14 creamy gloss and shimmer gloss shades, there really is an option (or two or three) for everyone. No sticky residue, no uncomfortable burning sensation, and no dry lips. Even Dedivanovic says it’s an absolute must-have.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.08 oz | <strong>Shades: </strong>14 <strong>| Key Feature:</strong> High-shine, sheer finish</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-complexion-product-makeup-by-mario-surrealskin-liquid-foundation></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Complexion Product</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Makeup By Mario SurrealSkin Liquid Foundation</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Makeup By Mario SurrealSkin Liquid Foundation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OzwlU1UV6b8S2xYQHVK9iXk9aUY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/makeup-by-mario-surrealskin-liquid-foundation-b00f479549a14ca3a5becf7321000547.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>A Makeup by Mario foundation</a> was a long-time coming — and not just for fans. Dedivanovic, who says creating the foundation was “a dream come true,” opted for a lighter formula than traditional, full-coverage options that’s buildable and still gives a perfected, glamorous finish.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ever the innovator, it features the brand’s MoistureGrip technology, which locks in hydration and keeps skin glowing — without sliding off the skin or looking greasy — for a whopping 12 hours. The formula really does feel (and look) groundbreaking. It melts into the skin easily, and leaves behind a sheen that provides coverage where needed but still feels breathable. What makes it so truly universal, though, is the impressive buildability, making it a truly customizable product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though we love the natural glow it provides, you may want to skip this if you have oily skin because it may make your complexion look a bit greasy rather than luminous.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>1 oz | <strong>Shades: </strong>30 <strong>| Key Feature:</strong> Natural, illuminating finish</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-blush-makeup-by-mario-soft-pop-blush-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Blush</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Makeup By Mario Soft Pop Blush Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Makeup By Mario Soft Pop Blush Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sYRSZVVQEt8vWSN2g9D8Y10gyCQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Makeup-By-Mario-Soft-Pop-Blush-Stick-f5fa383791b24c568769d847e18f8464.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cream blushes are a dime a dozen these days, so it takes a bit more to stand out. The Soft Pop Blush does just that, with six timeless shades that simultaneously feel natural yet inspired. The emollient-infused formula is ultra creamy and leaves a soft, dewy sheen on the skin without feeling too oily. The brush, which also appears on the sculpting sticks, features five nubs to centralize the product for fluid application — it’s yet another example of Dedivanovic’s intentionality in creating a true artistry brand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And a tip from Dedivanovic himself: After swiping the blush on the cheeks and blending upward and outward, he suggests tapping what’s leftover on the brush onto your lips and nose for a fresh, cohesive look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We will note that while the creamy formula blends beautifully, it can sometimes disturb foundation underneath leaving a patchy finish. To avoid this, blend gingerly or wear it on no foundation days for a gorgeous natural flush.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.37 oz | <strong>Shades: </strong>6 <strong>| Key Feature:</strong> Radiant, buildable blush</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-highlighter-makeup-by-mario-master-crystal-reflector-in-quartz></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Highlighter</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Makeup by Mario Master Crystal Reflector in Quartz</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Makeup by Mario Master Crystal Reflector in Quartz" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/k1t9tCdNKysdg-EkEeXzXF7pAgw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/makeup-by-mario-master-crystal-reflector-0504a603f3164628b10e63ff3c288321.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Inspired by Dedivanovic’s love of crystals, these multipurpose highlighters shine bright for the ultimate glow. These are by no means subtle — the payoff is strong but stunning. And it works just as well as a highlighter as a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shadow topper</a>, which is Dedivanovic’s favorite way to use the product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When used as a topper, it creates a spotlight effect on the eyelids that glimmers in the light. The formulation is bouncy and buildable, and the texture is almost creamy despite being a powder. Be sure to handle the compact with care, as the powder can crack easily when dropped.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.12 oz | <strong>Shades: </strong>3 <strong>| Key Feature:</strong> Glass-like glow</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-contour-makeup-by-mario-softsculpt-shaping-stick></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Contour</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Makeup by Mario Softsculpt Shaping Stick</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Makeup by Mario Softsculpt Shaping Stick" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7WYD9zgxMdUMGqZl-iDG0zAjXFM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/makeup-by-mario-softsculpt-shaping-stick-4df5edcbcab04f14a9dff70fa3a638e3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Kohl's</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps the most sought after item in Dedivanovic’s line (he is the king of contour, after all), this shaping stick features a buttery soft formula that melts into the skin for a softly sculpted look. The product dries down to a natural matte finish that adds warmth to the skin without coming off too orange or muddy. Plus, the stick makes contouring easy, even for a beginner, and its seamless blendability makes it virtually mistake-proof. Hesuggests applying it slightly above the hollows of the cheeks for a lifted, modern look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The one thing the product lacks, though, is an extensive shade range. We’d love to see the offerings expanded to make this more accessible to people of differing skin tones.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0.37 oz | <strong>Shades: </strong>6 <strong>| Key Feature:</strong> Blendable, matte finish</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-multifunctional-product-makeup-by-mario-softsculpt-transforming-skin-enhancer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Multifunctional Product</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Makeup by Mario Skin Enhancer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Makeup by Mario SoftSculpt Transforming Skin Enhancer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wVRoF2pt0r1yKduKZNpvJg7LSq0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Makeup-by-Mario-SoftSculpt-Transforming-Skin-Enhancer-de8124c541184bbbb0848603929a1ca4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The SoftSculpt Transforming Enhancer is truly a breakthrough innovation — the sheer balm warms and tints the skin while evening out tone for a blurred, warm glow. It’s not bronzer, it’s not highlighter, and it’s certainly not a foundation. Instead, it lives somewhere in the in-between.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That novelty is, unfortunately, lost on some users, who complain it’s a too-warm <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skin tint</a> or lackluster bronzer. But for those willing to lean into that ambiguity, it’s transformative — and like nothing else on the market. Meant for allover application, it melts into the skin and leaves behind a slight blurring effect and subtle warm, radiant glow. Use it as a one-and-done complexion sheen or over (or under!) makeup to warm the skin and add radiance; once you truly understand the product, the uses are endless.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 0.18 oz | <strong>Shades:</strong> 6<strong> </strong>|<strong> Key Feature: </strong>Sheer luminosity</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-brow-product-makeup-by-mario-master-hold-brow-gel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Brow Product</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Makeup By Mario Master Hold Brow Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Makeup By Mario Master Hold Brow Gel" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/myLRuq_K1XSc8FENunOJqVn5G-c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/makeup-by-mario-master-hold-brow-gel-0fd946a4a13b43afbaead103f4e60247.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To me, the Master Hold Brow Gel is perhaps the most slept-on product of the collection. The clear formula holds brows in a feathered, soft-looking stance and the lasting power is impressive to say the least. The dual-ended brush features a shorter side for applying the product, and a longer side for combing and defining hairs as needed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The result is laminated brows that look fuller and more volumized, with a clear, matte finish that never results in those pesky white balls of product some brow gels are wont to do.

The bristles are ever-so-slightly stiff to help with precise application, but fluffy enough that it easily blends product into the skin. It’s great for smooth, precise application and gives a slightly airbrushed quality to anything it touches.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Best for: </strong>Blending eyeshadow, dusting on powders | <strong>Shades: </strong>N/A <strong>| Key Feature:</strong> Soft, flexible bristles</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is Makeup by Mario cruelty-free?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yes!
