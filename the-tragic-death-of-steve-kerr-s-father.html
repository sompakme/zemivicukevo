But when it comes to Steve's success as a coach — he was named <a href=#>Coach of the Year</a> in 2016 — the 54-year-old claims his effective techniques were born from his father Dr. Malcolm Kerr's patience. After all, Steve has developed a reputation for being calm and quiet — but he was not always so composed.</p><p>"I had a horrible temper. I couldn't control it," Steve told the <a href=#>New York Times</a>&nbsp;in 2016.&nbsp;"Everything I did, if I missed a shot, if I made an out, I got so angry. It was embarrassing... He and my mom would be in the stands watching, and he never really said anything until we got home. He had the sense that I needed to learn on my own, and anything he would say would mean more after I calmed down."</p><p>Steve added that his father was what every Little League parent should be, as the casual and nonchalant talks would come after the fact, when they felt more like conversations rather than lectures. "He was an observer," Steve said. "And he let me learn and experience. I try to give our guys a lot of space and speak at the right time. Looking back on it, I think my dad was a huge influence on me, on my coaching." He's certainly left his mark.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2lgaIB5e9OhnGasopa0qq%2BMnZyarJhivKd50q2cr51doLKzvtJmnZqsmJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJ - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
