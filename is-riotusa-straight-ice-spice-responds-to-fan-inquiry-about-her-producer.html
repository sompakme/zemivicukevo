She went from being an aspiring rhymer in her early 20s, living in the Bronx, to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">spending time with</a> figures like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Taylor Swift</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a>. While some stars on the rise prefer to collaborate with an abundance of beatmakers to build their perfect sound, Spice has consistently worked with RiotUSA, who's been in her life long before she unleashed her 2022 breakout hit, "Feelin' U (Munch)."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Besides making magic together in the studio on songs like "Princess Diana" and "Pretty Girl," the former college classmates also enjoy kicking it when they're not working too. This past weekend, Riot was at the Super Bowl with his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">favourite femcee</a>, and some fans took note of how good he looked alongside Spice. Some have previously linked them together romantically after the "Deli" hitmaker hinted at being in a relationship last year, though others have their theories that DJ Enuff's son could be a part of the LGBTQ+ community.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ice-spice-clarifies-some-things-about-riotusa>Ice Spice Clarifies Some Things About RiotUSA</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this week, one of Nicki Minaj's Barbz shared a screenshot of the DM they sent to Riot, simply writing, "Yo." The busy creative hasn't yet replied, but the Twitter/X user remained persistent, tagging Spice in hopes of having her facilitate something. "[Put me on] @icespicee_," they pleaded. "He don't like boys," she simply responded, shutting down speculation about her friend's sexuality.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere in the news, Ice Spice has the attention of more than one man in the entertainment industry following <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Super Bowl weekend</a>. The redhead attended alongside Taylor Swift, who was front and center in the news while supporting her man, Travis Kelce. The New Yorker met NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal at the big game too, though he's now facing backlash for his provocative comments about the 24-year-old.
